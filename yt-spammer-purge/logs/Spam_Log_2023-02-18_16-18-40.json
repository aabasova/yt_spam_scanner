Once they do this, it will be far easier to understand the true intentions at work. So far as i understand the situation at present, The \"West\" (basically USA) is using the Ukrainian military and it's vast territory as a means of containing and absorbing Russia. There appears to be a belief high up in the Pentagon that the Ukrainian soldiers can prevent a larger European war from breaking out by winning on the battlefield in Ukraine. The pentagon also appears to feel that it is ok to sacrifice an unlimited number of Ukrainians, and the utter destruction of their beautiful cities, in order to avoid putting boots on the ground.  I am bitter about this which lead me to my comment. I see how invading Russia is impossible, but i do non understand why the rest of us are sitting around watching the war like it's entertainment rather than joining in the fight.

Once they do this, it will be far easier to understand the true intentions at work. So far as i understand the situation at present, The \"West\" (basically USA) is using the Ukrainian military and it's vast territory as a means of containing and absorbing Russia.

The pentagon also appears to feel that it is ok to sacrifice an unlimited number of Ukrainians, and the utter destruction of their beautiful cities, in order to avoid putting boots on the ground.  I am bitter about this which lead me to my comment. I see how invading Russia is impossible, but i do non understand why the rest of us are sitting around watching the war like it's entertainment rather than joining in the fight.

They applied sanctions, got a spectacular kick in the balls of the dollar, then proceeded to order the Ukrainian Nazis to bomb the Russians in Donbass. Russia has asked for eight years to stop and fulfill the requests of the people of Donbass. Russia prepares its hypersonic nuclear triad to settle and the incapable England achieves its objective putting the European Union in the slipper. Indebted and able to make its debt disappear, the United States wants to opt for nuclear war. You can write that on cave walls.", "videoTitle": "German Chancellor: Prepare for a long war in Ukraine", "matchReason": null, "isSpam": "False"}

Ive been living in my car 3 years because my landlords shoved me and poured piss on my head just for being a great guitarist. I got attacked multiple times then got charged with assault after. First I was assaulted by a weird guy opening my door and reaching through my window over naked kids too young to be publicly seen. I asked him to stop cleaning their genitals directly in front of me because all 3 kids were old enough to walk and talk. The second time by a hotel owner after i asked him advice for dealing with heckles while rehearsing guitar. He just said i was insane so i asked for my cash money back because i hadn't stayed. He refused to give me the money and after leaving and reentering he put me in series of headlocks and wall slams. Eventually he gave me the cash but charged me with battery. The police never listen to what I say because it's all favors for favors. The police tackled me at 3 am for missing the arraignment. I was asleep in my car, thought I was dreaming and tried to simply walk away before getting tackled by 3 cops. One feigned an injury like I tackled him as if it were soccer. Then they put me in jail 3 days. The police have woken me up asking if I have weapons, babies or just ID several times flashlights in my eyes. My car broke down and I missed court. My public defender offered to reschedule but I still got arrested and forced to plea guilty to two assault misdemeanors or spend 30 days in jail. I had to spend 2 weeks in jail, contracted covid 19 and didn't even go to my court case because of the virus. Since then they tried to arrest me again for the same thing then let me go. They also searched my entire car, cuffed me and stripped my sex doll another night just for parking at a shared ATM at 7:30 pm. They said if i had the sexdoll again, which was packed away, they'd arrest me. They followed me after and made weird noises. I littered profusely in front of them. After they followed me 2 more nights and circled my car at the grocery store the next day.\n\nEverytime I rehearse guitar people honk, rev engines or fly airplanes over my head. It's like I pissed off the unions or something. \n\nYears ago I got two famous follows from Ronnie Canizaro and Cameron Losche of Born Of Osiris. I also got video likes from Circa Survive and Despised Icon. Losche left me fire comments and Ronnie liked several videos of my guitar. At the time I didn't know how to use video and audio separately then combine them using newly released windows 10 programs. Meaning I recorded all my videos acoustically opening them for complete sabotage. Every video I have on my Instagram is ruined by loud slams or revs. I lost both famous follows saying crazy stuff online.\n\nAfter being sabotaged acoustically I got hacked on my computer. They changed the tempo of my song Deadinthemeadow and glitched the final track of musicisdeadandsoareyou out of existence. It was a slow song of piano and guitar layering. Now it freezes my PC and I can't get broadband internet to reinstall anything. \n\nI went insane from the revs as I was cut off from my divinities. I got so rowdy I was banned from Instagram. I said every crude thing possible. It was so hard to see ugly teenage girls playing simple guitar smiling with tenfold the likes and follows I had. \n\nJust remember that I didn't really express any political beliefs other than this:\nAmerica is mankind's first stand against our crude and corrupt nature. Remember the North fought slavery since day one though they didn't see blacks as equals. It's still a start. Every American is educated to question both sides and make the right decision. We are educated to accept gays, blacks, transgender and Muslims. Luminous beings we are not this crude matter. You might want to try believing in something. We don't make women marry at 14 or 16. We let them read and discover their eternities. The populace didn't decide to bomb Japan. It was a committee. \n\nI am sorry for being so crude but I have to fight for guitar.\n\nAll my video games and cell phones are being hacked too.\n\nI need a job so bad. I do security, janitorial, write or play guitar. I'm getting side pains from the collection calls. \n\nHere is my 12 track college degree of unrivaled guitar slides, bends, breakdowns and fret reach/chords. \n\nEchozeta.bandcamp.com \n\nHere is my poetry and 3 story pitches. My poetry is very boomy. \n\nEchozeta.blogspot.com \n\nPeople won't stop break checking me subtly or getting in my way walking either.\n\nWhen my mom dies I'm gonna try and kill myself cause that mob won't let me make minimum wage.\n\nI am 35 starting a highschool job with no references or family. At 23 I was diagnosed permanently partially disabled in my back from falling off a 14 ft ladder under poor supervision.", "commentID": "UgyTS4MET6ttGOFyCEx4AaABAg", "videoID": "oWv2_aqu2Vo", "timestamp": "2023-02-17T22:01:45Z", "originalCommentID": null, "uploaderChannelID": "UCupvZG-5ko_eiXAupbDfxWw", "uploaderChannelName": "CNN", "textUnsanitized": "At heart I'm joyous but I wanna die and I'm almost ready to kill someone literally.

After they followed me 2 more nights and circled my car at the grocery store the next day.\n\nEverytime I rehearse guitar people honk, rev engines or fly airplanes over my head. It's like I pissed off the unions or something. \n\nYears ago I got two famous follows from Ronnie Canizaro and Cameron Losche of Born Of Osiris. I also got video likes from Circa Survive and Despised Icon. Losche left me fire comments and Ronnie liked several videos of my guitar. At the time I didn't know how to use video and audio separately then combine them using newly released windows 10 programs. Meaning I recorded all my videos acoustically opening them for complete sabotage. Every video I have on my Instagram is ruined by loud slams or revs. I lost both famous follows saying crazy stuff online.\n\nAfter being sabotaged acoustically I got hacked on my computer. They changed the tempo of my song Deadinthemeadow and glitched the final track of musicisdeadandsoareyou out of existence. It was a slow song of piano and guitar layering. Now it freezes my PC and I can't get broadband internet to reinstall anything. \n\nI went insane from the revs as I was cut off from my divinities. I got so rowdy I was banned from Instagram. I said every crude thing possible. It was so hard to see ugly teenage girls playing simple guitar smiling with tenfold the likes and follows I had. \n\nJust remember that I didn't really express any political beliefs other than this:\nAmerica is mankind's first stand against our crude and corrupt nature. Remember the North fought slavery since day one though they didn't see blacks as equals. It's still a start. Every American is educated to question both sides and make the right decision. We are educated to accept gays, blacks, transgender and Muslims. Luminous beings we are not this crude matter. You might want to try believing in something. We don't make women marry at 14 or 16. We let them read and discover their eternities. The populace didn't decide to bomb Japan. It was a committee. \n\nI am sorry for being so crude but I have to fight for guitar.\n\nAll my video games and cell phones are being hacked too.\n\nI need a job so bad. I do security, janitorial, write or play guitar. I'm getting side pains from the collection calls. \n\nHere is my 12 track college degree of unrivaled guitar slides, bends, breakdowns and fret reach/chords. \n\nEchozeta.bandcamp.com \n\nHere is my poetry and 3 story pitches. My poetry is very boomy. \n\nEchozeta.blogspot.com \n\nPeople won't stop break checking me subtly or getting in my way walking either.\n\nWhen my mom dies I'm gonna try and kill myself cause that mob won't let me make minimum wage.\n\nI am 35 starting a highschool job with no references or family. At 23 I was diagnosed permanently partially disabled in my back from falling off a 14 ft ladder under poor supervision.", "videoTitle": "German Chancellor: Prepare for a long war in Ukraine", "matchReason": "Filter Match", "isSpam": "True"}

Attacks on cement plants, stores and fuel supplies are all happening, like the huge explosion in South Africa, ports and warehouses lit on fire.*  The Catholic Church is the Church that rides the Roman Empire(that is why it is called the\"Roman Catholic Church\").  *The Pope is the King of the Vatican City State that controls the Roman Empire.  The Pope has 666 in Latin on his crown (vicarivs filii dei).  Revelation 17,18 describes his system including what the leaders wear(Scarlet-Catholic Cardinals and Purple-Catholic Bishops, and the British Empire(UK) wears these colours also).  Revelation mentions that this organization is responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth.  WW2 was a war to hide their being exposed.*  They attacked Acts2:44,45 of the Bible, just as they are now.  *The Pope claims to be the head of God's Church and the British Royals claim they are the head of the Church, but neither are, but Jesus(Yeshua) of the Bible is the only head of the Church and all others are brothers.  Those who follow the two legs of the Roman Empire are destroyed by God's Kingdom as mentioned in Daniel 2:44,45, Daniel12:4.  Daniel showed that Rome split in to two Empires Catholic and Protestant.  The lies of the Roman Church could no longer be hidden, so Rome decided to take control of the opposition.*  The Bible says that the true Sabbath is a sign and reinforces the covenant between God and his true followers.  *Protestantism and Catholicism both have the same fake Sabbath, called the \"Lord's day\", to mislead people in to thinking the Lord mentioned is God and that it is his Sabbath, but it is not.  According to their own writings the \" Lord's Day\" comes the day after God's Sabbath.  So people break God's law every week by observing the wrong day.*  That they say the \"Lord's Day\" comes after the Sabbath does not mean that that is true though.  *In Revelation God warns his people to come out of this blasphemous organization(*Revelation 18:4 is there an other Church riding the Roman Empire?*).*  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic and started WW2.

Poland had said that the military was there because Russia was sending migrants from the Middle East there.  Why would the Italian Airforce be there for migrants?  Migrants have a legal right under International law to immigrate from a war zone.  Poland and Italy are Catholic and Zellensky claims that Ukraine is becoming a Catholic State.  They have already banned the Orthodox Church there.  NATO's Ukraine proxy government has banned the Russian language(which many only speak), banned all opposition parties, so how can this be called a fight for Democracy? Two regions which refused to be part of the \"new Ukraine\" voted to separate in to their own Countries, but Ukraine/NATO would not recognize them.*  Britain installed two Prime Ministers which were not elected, and is instituting a 15 minute from home travel limit, with out a permit.  *Is that freedom?*  (king)Charles is an illegal heir.  *WW2 was to hide the German Nazi that married the British Queen, instead of her taking his name, he took hers.  Philip was a German, but renounced that to become a Greek citizen, and from there moved to Britain.  He became a Duke out of thin air and then a prince, and then married Queen Elizabeth.*  Catholicism and Protestantism are two legs of the Roman Beast.  *The Roman Empire made (false)Christianity the State religion after trying unsuccessfully to exterminate the true believers.  The Emperor brought in all the idols of false worship in to the church as Saints.  The Pope claims to be a celibate successor of the Bible's Apostle Peter, but according to the Bible, Peter had a mother in law, and if you have a mother in law, you have a wife.  Jesus healed Peter's wife's mother.  Paul said he chose to remain single, but could take a wife, just as Peter and the other Apostle's had done.* The whole system is a fraud, that kills to stay in power.  *Remember Britain and Australia lifting all corona restrictions, only to completely lock you down?
