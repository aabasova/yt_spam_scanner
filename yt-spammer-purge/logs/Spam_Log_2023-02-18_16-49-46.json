PSG is not comparable because they've not got the players of the other top teams as all their star big names are over the hill or in the case of Mbappe, not enough and they have only themselves to compete against where as in Spain it's 4 or 5 good teams to keep their level up. Even so just because France is even more of a farmers league it doesn't change the fact the Spanish league is as well. Bayern exactly the same in Germany as they actually have good old German efficiency and tactics as well as very high level players which carries them further than PSG.

Bout to get nerdy so bear with me.\n\nIf I wanted to look at how dominant a team is in a league, I can't just look at their raw points or goal difference because it doesn't take into account how relatively good it is. Instead, I need to find the league's goal difference's standard deviation. Then, I need to find how many standard deviation's a team's goal difference is from the mean, which will be 0. There's a decent amount of math that goes into it, which I wont explain unless asked.\n\nUsing Standard deviation is important because it takes into account how variable  and relatively good the goal differences are. For example: If Bayern Munich has a goal difference of 20 for a season, it might seem like they had a bad year. But, if the standard deviation for goal difference in the Bundesliga was 5, then Bayern's goal difference would be four standard deviations above league average, which is an extraordinary performance. \n\nIf a league's standard deviation for goal difference is lower, it means teams tend to be closer to one another in their abilities because their goal differences tend to be closer to zero on average. The more similar everyone's goal difference is, the more competitive the league tends to be. So, A lower standard deviations for the league tends to mean it is more competitive.\n\nTaking all this into account, what I did was determine both the epl and la liga's standard deviations for goal difference. I then used that to determine how many standard deviations from the mean top teams in each league were. I did this for the past 11 seasons. Then I took the average of each team and league over this 11 season timeframe. Here are the results:\n\nPrem: 27.45\nLa Liga: 27.63\n\nBarca: 2.37\nMadrid: 2.04\nAtletico: 1.25\n\nMan City: 2.03\nLiverpool: 1.32\nChelsea: 1.11\nMan U: 1.07\nTottenham: 0.92\nArsenal: 0.87\n\nWhat this means is that statistically, the Prem and La Liga are just as competitive. The variance of the goals scored across both leagues are practically the same. If the Prem were more competitive, we would expect to see it's goal difference to have a much lower standard deviation than La Liga's because in more competitive league we expect teams to have a closer goal difference. \n\nAnother thing to note is that Real Madrid and Man City have basically the same average standard deviation. This means that Man City has been just as dominant in the EPL over the last 11 seasons as Madrid has been in La Liga. To suggest the overall level of play in the EPL has been significantly higher than La Liga would also be saying that Man City has been a significantly better team than Real Madrid, which we both know isn't true. If La Liga is truly a farmer's league, wouldn't we expect Real Madrid to dominate at a much higher level than Man City dominates the Prem?\n\nYes, La Liga is more skewed towards the very top, but both league are still equally competitive.
