They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.\n\n8 In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pollute their own bodies, reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings. 9 But even the archangel Michael, when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses, did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said, “The Lord rebuke you!”[d] 10 Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand, and the very things they do understand by instinct—as irrational animals do—will destroy them.\n\n11 Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam’s error; they have been destroyed in Korah’s rebellion.\n\n12 These people are blemishes at your love feasts, eating with you without the slightest qualm—shepherds who feed only themselves. They are clouds without rain, blown along by the wind; autumn trees, without fruit and uprooted—twice dead. 13 They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shame; wandering stars, for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever.\n\n14 Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them: “See, the Lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones 15 to judge everyone, and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against him.”[e] 16 These people are grumblers and faultfinders; they follow their own evil desires; they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.\n\nA Call to Persevere\n\n17 But, dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold. 18 They said to you, “In the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires.” 19 These are the people who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit.\n\n20 But you, dear friends, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, 21 keep yourselves in God’s love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.\n\n22 Be merciful to those who doubt; 23 save others by snatching them from the fire; to others show mercy, mixed with fear—hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.[f]\n\nDoxology\n\n24 To him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy— 25 to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore! Amen.", "videoTitle": "Broadmoor Psych Ward Exposed | Real Stories Full-Length Documentary", "matchReason": "Filter Match", "isSpam": "True"}

It looks massive. Its hard to believe it only holds 250 patients, more like 660 patients.  Broadmoor was a total horrific place in the 1940s 50s. Patients were so badly treated with electric shock treatment by putting electricity volts through there heads in a bid to get rid or cure mental illness. Pure evil place to be in. By the 1980s the staff who were big strong 6ft men were just battering them for there own fun, till the patients took over the place and burnend alot of it to the ground and smashed the rest to bits. And thats still meant to happen today. But not as bad. Or they would burn the new place to ground and the governer would know why they did it. Wich they cant afford. It hasnt changend.", "videoTitle": "Broadmoor Psych Ward Exposed | Real Stories Full-Length Documentary", "matchReason": null, "isSpam": "False"}

I used to work in a low security locked facility and the common denominator was usually the feeling, sense or physical experience of being unwanted and unloved as a child. Parents have a lot to answer for when they screw up their kids then dump them in care or on relatives because they’re ‘evil, the devil, weird, not a normal little boy or girl’ etc because the kid acts out and does something perceived as screwed up or does commit a crime when all it was, was a cry for some attention and to be noticed.\n\nObviously it’s not everyone who ends up on these wards; I’ve met many with very loving and very desperate families too; but abandonment or feeling hated and unwanted as a child is definitely up there as a top, common feeling among patients with illnesses such as schizophrenia, psychosis, BPD, PD etc.\n\nWith my whole heart I hope that ‘Adam’ and ‘Dylan’ were successful integrating into their MSU’s. What a lot of people don’t realise is that these patients also very easily develop attachment anxiety and a sort of Stockholm syndrome to the routine, staff, walls and order that they feel was the first time somebody gave a genuine crap about them. The number of ‘reoffenders’ who have say one bad day, panic and do something that they know will get them transferred back to their previous ‘safety net’ is heartbreaking. A lot of the time it’s not that they want to hurt staff or another patient, it’s just the surest and quickest way they know that will get them sent back to familiarity. Some patients also routinely jeopardise their own progress for fear of leaving these units because they are fully aware of the stigmas that still fly around in society, which is so sad. And hard to break through.\n\nImagine being told your entire childhood that you’re not wanted and often neglected as such, developing a mental disorder because the brain tried to find a way to cope with that physical and mental trauma, then working through a gruelling recovery programme that; as this documentary shows can take 15+ years, to finally reach opportunity to integrate into society, only for society to brand you as a ‘weirdo’, ‘dangerous’, ‘should be locked up’, ‘shouldn’t be living here’ etc….. And society wonders why some of these people become the things that they brand them. All their life they have been told by other people what they are. Society has as much to answer for as some parents in this scenario.\n\nIt takes 2 seconds for someone to make judgement and run their mouth. Then go about their life and forget that comment after a few minutes or whatever. Someone on a recovery path could hear that and be affected for LIFE because of someone who doesn’t know them. Please, please, please people - always think about your words and never dismiss someone who’s been in a facility. There are often kind, funny, capable, passionate, empathetic people behind even the worst disorders and symptoms.\n\nJust make some effort to get to know the person, not the illness. That gesture alone could be the positive intervention someone needs to drive their goal of reintegration.\n\nWe are all born pure beings - we don’t know what to think or feel. We are taught it.
