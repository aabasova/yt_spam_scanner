Mazarr summarized a recent RAND Corporation study commissioned by the US Defense Department\u2019s Office of Net Assessment on the age-old question, \u201cWhat Makes a Power Great?\u201d\u25aa\u201cThe United States ultimately prevailed over the Soviet Union in the Cold War,\u201d Mazarr argued, \u201cbecause it was more energetic, innovative, productive, and legitimate.\u201d But can the same be said of the United States by comparison with China today?\u25aa Here\u2019s the RAND answer: The United States displays some of the characteristics of a once dominant power that has passed its competitive prime: by some important measures, it is complacent, highly bureaucratized, and seeking short-term gains and rents rather than long-term productive breakthroughs. It is socially and politically divided, cognizant of the need for reforms yet unwilling or unable to make them, and suffering a loss of faith in the shared national project that once animated it.",

If NATO was not doing nothing, which happened with Crimea in 2014, Russia then attacked whole Ukraine. So because NATO was okay with war in Georgia, we had Crimea gone in 2014 and because NATO was silent with Crimea we now have whole Ukraine. So two mistakes were done by NATO. I hope this time NATO sticks to totally destroy Russia in Ukraine. If NATO was silent with whole Ukraine you would have Moldova, Baltic states and most likely Poland. So I'm happy NATO woke up but what I am not happy is with the weapons Ukraine is getting. Everything is donation. NO!!! NATO war factories must work 24/7 to give Ukraine everything they need. NATO is complaining that Ukraine is using too many artillery shells. Well give them smarter missiles so they can destroy Russian position with one missile rather than many artillery shells.

No one destroyed yugoslavia! they did it by themself. in 1991 slowenia, kroatia and others wanted to leave yugolslavia, because they where dominated by the serbs - its was their own decision. Kosovo was different. but after the experience with serbia in the bosnia-war (concentration camps, killing of civilians, brutal muder of the male population of srebrenica after surrender) let to the decision, wrong according to international law, to step in. But is kosovo now the 51 state of the us? no. 1991 irak war was rightfully, with the approval of un, 2003 not - that was a big mistake and i was happy germany hasnt joint the coalition. libya was wrong too. syria? in the beginning there was no american soldier there, arab countries where much more in support of the uprising. somalia? Puh, it was a civil-war torn country on the brink of mass-femin, the americans stepted in because people worldwide ask for that - after the warlords took away the humanitarian aid from the people - what had america to gain in somalia? nothing. you mention ukraine - thats a joke? russia attacked ukrain without any reason. the donbas conflict dyed slowly out - in 2021 there was only sporadic fighting, nearly no casualties on both sides. nato membership of ukraine was never a question since 2009, when germany and france voted against. and merkel and scholz would never supported the membership. But russia attacked. in feb.22 putin said his goal is denazification, demilitarisation and donbas are the reasons for the smo ( a joke not to call that a war), in sept.22 russia annexed 2 other oblasts more! and kharkiv was on the same list - but the russians where kickt out of that oblast during the balaklia-offensiv. and i am pretty sure putin want to annex odessa too. long answer, but i think the west learned of its mistakes and would not do the same like in libya. but war to conquer foreign land and destroy ukrainians - i will urge my country to do all what it takes to prevent this. no one threatens russian territorial integrety (1991 boarders) or the system of RF - if you want your putin i am fine with that. but i think putin made a big, big mistake with invading ukraine. And i am not sure if the RF will survive this war - but not because of nato, it mayby crumble from the inside. the RF is, the clever, domination of slavic people over a lot of ethnic minorities - which dying mostly in ukraine. we will see how long those people accept russian dominace in the future - the war will mayby be a catalyst for independence. after the war russia is weakened and mayby not be able to suppress those movements like in chechnia. but thats not my problem",

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, we were supposed to be done with the idea of Russian threat to the world order.  Now, having failed at democratic reform, Putin's kleptocratic, authoritarian regime is threatening the world order again.  I just hope the right wing isolationists and left wing peaceniks can be kept in check until Ukraine reclaims its territory and gets the security guarantees it needs, or else we're likely to be in for a long series of wars pushed by militaristic dictators around the world.  The free world can't show weakness here.  We can't appease dictators.  We need to stand our ground protecting the rules based world order, or there will be a great deal of suffering in the decades to come.

Rapid attacks in the Donetsk basin.Imagine, 80 years ago, the British press rejoiced at the liberation of Donbass by Russian troops. And today these bastards are on the side of the Nazis.I am a Ukrainian girl, I am now on the territory of Ukraine. I'll explain it to you. The bloody neo-Nazi junta started the war against the Ukrainian people in 2014, which was brought to power by Western political strategists, nine years ago the war began in Ukraine, the pro-Western fascist junta began to rob and destroy us Ukrainians, destroyed our economy and plunged the country into chaos. The Russians came to us in Ukraine to end the war that these Satanists, orcs of the Bandera junta, have been waging against us, against the Ukrainian people, for nine years.If you think that the evil totalitarian Russia has attacked the good democratic Ukraine, if you believe in all the lies of the globalist media, then you are an ideal slave of the system with the intelligence of a fetus. And now don't complain that your standard of living in the West has fallen sharply and everything has become more expensive, it's the globalists losing to Putin, now they have started robbing Westerners. This is a stupid skunk for you for supporting murderers, neo-Nazis of the Bandera junta of Kiev, for writing here the slogan of Hitler's accomplices Slava Ukraine. You are a stupid slave of the system, a slave of banks and multinational corporations, your globalist masters have already lost, the forces of Good are winning, and the forces of Evil that you believe and serve are losing, so you will live worse and worse, a stupid slave of the system.Neo-Nazis and Satanists who came to power in Ukraine in 2014 with the help of a bloody coup d'etat are holding us, the people of Ukraine, hostage, they need us Ukrainians to hide behind us from the advancing Russian army, so the liberation of my Ukraine is going so slowly, Russian soldiers are trying to save our lives by liberating my Ukraine from the criminals of the neo-Nazis Bandera juntas, and junta terrorists use us as a shield. If we were liberated not by Russians but by Americans, then the largest cities in Ukraine would have already been destroyed to the ground and there would have been millions of civilian victims.American arms sellers need this war to continue, so they force their European vassals to arm Zelensky's terrorists, so that then it is profitable for these vassals to sell American weapons. Therefore, the American owners ordered Zelensky to start this war. But they did not expect that Russia would stand up for the Donbass attacked by Zelensky and launch an operation to protect DonbassAbout the earthquake in Turkey and Syria - no Western countries have sent aid to Syria, only Russians and Cubans are engaged in rescuing Syrians, two countries that have been under harsh Western sanctions for many years. Apparently, for the West, Syrians are second-class people. You, the people of the West, have been racists and have remained so",

This disgraceful legacy continues today, in the proxy war that Washington is waging on Russia via Ukraine. Fake news echoed by the press has served as a powerful form of U.S. information warfare.\u00a0 A co-founding officer of the CIA, Frank Wisner, boasted that the U.S. spy agency had so many assets in news rooms across the world that Washington could play the press like a musician, in order to manipulate public opinion. U.S. media outlets have a kind of symbiotic relationship with the government, and especially with intelligence agencies like the CIA, which act on behalf of Wall Street and powerful corporations. U.S. spies selectively leak stories to journalists, controlling media narratives to serve elite economic interests.",

China would be looking for a degraded U.S. condition with some of those arms that would cause supply issues in the Pacific. I am sure the U.S. military is understood on that. Just don't know if China is really understood that there things like the M 1 has been in production for years as well as may other systems that are state of the art with updates. And the U.S. military becomes more a lined with new system that can be updated with ease as is in the design to be updated from the beginning. Why would China want to fly a big balloon over the United States?  Right over the area that the B 2 is based in fact. What intelligence could be gained in truth. You would have to be able to identify patterns and that would take loidering. Communications is something that would give an insight in to what? Peace time operations? Any operations in this country having to do with the military are not subject to an all out war footing at this time. The Chinese weather spy Balloon was not a good move. It does state something about Chinese intent though. Satellites can pin point locations and even give counts and with some imaging even condtions on the ground as well as under the ground. Local communications my be harder to identify but then any sensitive communications have to be transmitted through secure lines in the government and military. So the military is well understood on listening devices. Transmission locations can be important also. There are ways to cause a misunderstood location report of communications that is just as simple as street directions. China gained nothing that was of any real value or the balloon would have been shot down where it was first spotted. Now why would China need some kind of sensitive locational info or movement or whatever a balloon can get that a satellite cannot? Russia threatened Nuclear usages also. How do you think that showed up in U.S. government movements. The U.S. navy has or has not altered it's conditions with the Russian Ukraine war. Maybe there was a question on some kind of platform of the U.S. military that China couldn't identify without a flyover. China has stated that U.S. territory would be at risk if there was involvement in the defense of Taiwan. The world is becoming a dicey place with those dictators on the march.",

Please accept the errors of your country, the EU and USA to let it happen. End of the day, negotiation for a settlement of this conflict is the only option. NATO and its supporters must learn to address Russian anxiety about including Ukraine in NATO, it was unnecessary, dangerous and reckless on former German Chancellor Miss Angela Merkel's part to say,  We signed the Minsk agreement  for buying time to arms Ukraine. How fair and prudent was that in 2014? This conflict must end not for Ukrainians but for your country, NATO, the USA and the whole world; you have risked our existence as human beings on this planet; one rough step and the chain reaction comes. Mr. Scholz, your few dozen or few hundred tanks or fighter planes would not break Russians' will to save their face and integrity and ensure their sense of security; it's as apparent as writing on the wall; please make a wise decision to end this conflict; Germany can't make historical mistakes in two centuries, 1039 and 2022, and have a prosperous and secure future for Europe and itself.

Russia's political situation and the world are constantly evolving, and predicting what the future holds for Putin and his criminal administration is obvious.

It means the manufacturer will no longer produce in batches like 100 tanks or something, they will rather change production to a way to produce tanks or ammunition at a rate at which it is consumed. It means continuous production at a high rate over a long period is now the new goal. The German government will no longer place orders like this: Give me 10,000 artillery shells, and the manufacturer says: You can have 1000 from storage, 5000 till the end of the year and 10,000 at the end of next year. The new order will be like this: give us 2000 shells every month for the next five years, but if you can produce 3000 we will take it. This gives the manufacturer the signal to build new streamlined production lines for highly automated mass production round the clock, hire more workers, give larger orders of materials etc. A totally different ball game. Up to now, NATO countries deliver the old stock, some of it dates back to the cold war. The plan up to now was to replenish it with new production over the next years. But delivery time gets longer and longer and new orders will take at least three years and this poses the risk, that the stockpiles will get almost completely depleted over the year.",

I cannot help but conclude that Europe has staggered blindly into this war because its nature has never changed since the war in 1914t. Europeans did not learn lessons about the value of peace from previous wars and the lives lost during the World Wars were in vain. Take a look at East Asia, there hasn't been any significant military conflict for the last 43 years. The conflicts in East and South-east Asia after the Second World War that resulted in significant lives lost were conflicts that were instigated and perpertrated by Western powers (Vietnam war with US, Korean war with US led coalition). And now the US is actively edging the separatist government in Taiwan to provoke the region into an armed conflict for the sole purpose of delaying China's rise to an equal power to the US.",

Schultz is still afraid of the Russian response to Western aid to Ukraine and he is still afraid of going all-in to help Ukraine to end this war ASAP, meaning this year 2023, by providing Ukraine with what they need -> a minimum of at least ~150-200 Leopard tanks, 4th gen. fighter jets and sufficient anti-aircraft in order to stop substantial damages to Ukrainian infrastructure and civilian deaths by Russian air-raids. 2). Schultz is unwilling to discard Putin as a serious partner on geo-political issues. Putin is a modern dictator, he has been for almost 2 decades and Putin is NOT a partner for peace. Putin has been the source of conflict for the past 20 years. Since the Russia-Chechnyan war, to date. And Putin has continuously been trying to undermine Western alliances by manipulating democratic election processes, through the continuous deployment of cyber attacks and by spreading fake-news to targetted Western audiences. Putin, together with the Chinese dictator Xi, represent the axis of evil and are the main threats to the existence of human kind. And they should be treated accordingly...Schultz needs to get with the program and stop being a limp dick.",

Do you not see that Russia has consumed all of it and are still ready for whatever else you all may be having remaining? Only just one man and his army, facing the entire Western governments, and have almost destroyed the weapon stockpile of the entire NATO, and yet seem not to have even started.

Defending eastern UKR has to be converted into a counter offensive not unlike a blitzkrieg that severs the Russian ground forces to open up a pincer move to take Crimea. Crimea has to be the prime target aimed at being achieved within the next 3 months which would impact Putin's backing in the Kremlin. Ammunition stockpliles have neen sorely overlooked by yet again politicians. I stand by Zelenskyy and his efforts to galvanise the West into the right weapons at the right time.... In fear may be too late. Russia's second major offensive expected on 24 Fen 23 has been talked about for months - why hasn't the West been prepared? Politicians with their heads in the sand or snow blinded by false threats of escalation - not good poker players!!. So its OK for Putin to escalate the war and continue to murder thousands of Innocent UKR civilians but not UKR and its Western allies to escalate it in their defence????!!!!!.",

So far as i understand the situation at present, The West (basically USA) is using the Ukrainian military and it's vast territory as a means of containing and absorbing Russia. There appears to be a belief high up in the Pentagon that the Ukrainian soldiers can prevent a larger European war from breaking out by winning on the battlefield in Ukraine. The pentagon also appears to feel that it is ok to sacrifice an unlimited number of Ukrainians, and the utter destruction of their beautiful cities, in order to avoid putting boots on the ground.  I am bitter about this which lead me to my comment. I see how invading Russia is impossible, but i do non understand why the rest of us are sitting around watching the war like it's entertainment rather than joining in the fight. And people are talking about this going on for years or decades. If we just had one elected official in Europe or the US,  then this could be ended decisively in a few months and Russia can go back to being whatever backward corrupt state it choses to be and has been since the Byzantines found it.  Instead, i fear, Taiwan is next.",

Back there the US applied the coup d'\u00e9tat in Ukraine.

They applied sanctions against Russia because they failed to change their government. They poisoned Navalny, who was only hanging around with them to blame Russia. They applied sanctions, got a spectacular kick in the balls of the dollar, then proceeded to order the Ukrainian Nazis to bomb the Russians in Donbass. Russia has asked for eight years to stop and fulfill the requests of the people of Donbass.

Ive been living in my car 3 years because my landlords shoved me and poured piss on my head just for being a great guitarist. I got attacked multiple times then got charged with assault after. First I was assaulted by a weird guy opening my door and reaching through my window over naked kids too young to be publicly seen. I asked him to stop cleaning their genitals directly in front of me because all 3 kids were old enough to walk and talk. The second time by a hotel owner after i asked him advice for dealing with heckles while rehearsing guitar. He just said i was insane so i asked for my cash money back because i hadn't stayed. He refused to give me the money and after leaving and reentering he put me in series of headlocks and wall slams. Eventually he gave me the cash but charged me with battery. The police never listen to what I say because it's all favors for favors. The police tackled me at 3 am for missing the arraignment. I was asleep in my car, thought I was dreaming and tried to simply walk away before getting tackled by 3 cops. One feigned an injury like I tackled him as if it were soccer. Then they put me in jail 3 days. The police have woken me up asking if I have weapons, babies or just ID several times flashlights in my eyes. My car broke down and I missed court. My public defender offered to reschedule but I still got arrested and forced to plea guilty to two assault misdemeanors or spend 30 days in jail. I had to spend 2 weeks in jail, contracted covid 19 and didn't even go to my court case because of the virus. Since then they tried to arrest me again for the same thing then let me go. They also searched my entire car, cuffed me and stripped my sex doll another night just for parking at a shared ATM at 7:30 pm. They said if i had the sexdoll again, which was packed away, they'd arrest me. They followed me after and made weird noises. I littered profusely in front of them. After they followed me 2 more nights and circled my car at the grocery store the next day.Everytime I rehearse guitar people honk, rev engines or fly airplanes over my head. It's like I pissed off the unions or something. Years ago I got two famous follows from Ronnie Canizaro and Cameron Losche of Born Of Osiris. I also got video likes from Circa Survive and Despised Icon. Losche left me fire comments and Ronnie liked several videos of my guitar. At the time I didn't know how to use video and audio separately then combine them using newly released windows 10 programs. Meaning I recorded all my videos acoustically opening them for complete sabotage. Every video I have on my Instagram is ruined by loud slams or revs. I lost both famous follows saying crazy stuff online.After being sabotaged acoustically I got hacked on my computer. They changed the tempo of my song Deadinthemeadow and glitched the final track of musicisdeadandsoareyou out of existence. It was a slow song of piano and guitar layering. Now it freezes my PC and I can't get broadband internet to reinstall anything. I went insane from the revs as I was cut off from my divinities. I got so rowdy I was banned from Instagram. I said every crude thing possible. It was so hard to see ugly teenage girls playing simple guitar smiling with tenfold the likes and follows I had. Just remember that I didn't really express any political beliefs other than this:America is mankind's first stand against our crude and corrupt nature. Remember the North fought slavery since day one though they didn't see blacks as equals. It's still a start. Every American is educated to question both sides and make the right decision. We are educated to accept gays, blacks, transgender and Muslims. Luminous beings we are not this crude matter. You might want to try believing in something. We don't make women marry at 14 or 16. We let them read and discover their eternities. The populace didn't decide to bomb Japan. It was a committee. I am sorry for being so crude but I have to fight for guitar.All my video games and cell phones are being hacked too.I need a job so bad. I do security, janitorial, write or play guitar. I'm getting side pains from the collection calls. Here is my 12 track college degree of unrivaled guitar slides, bends, breakdowns and fret reach/chords. Echozeta.bandcamp.com Here is my poetry and 3 story pitches. My poetry is very boomy. Echozeta.blogspot.com People won't stop break checking me subtly or getting in my way walking either.When my mom dies I'm gonna try and kill myself cause that mob won't let me make minimum wage.I am 35 starting a highschool job with no references or family. At 23 I was diagnosed permanently partially disabled in my back from falling off a 14 ft ladder under poor supervision.",

First, Joe lets a Chinese spy balloon slowly traverse the length and breadth of the country before finally shooting it down over the Atlantic Ocean. After it had several days to leisurely transmit the intelligence it gathered back home to the Chinese Communist Party. Yet now the democrat Biden administration, perhaps chagrined, is blasting anything and everything out of the sky, even while acknowledging that these \u201cunidentified flying objects\u201d could be our own weather service\u2014or corporate\u2014balloons. What the hell?! Wouldn\u2019t/shouldn\u2019t we know if they were? Weather Service balloons are launched by another branch of government, one closely related to the Department of Defense\u2026that shot them down.Our democrat government was apparently, unable to detect the giant Chinese spy balloon. That was left to Trump voters of Montana, who happened to look up into the clear blue sky. The official explanation for why our democrat government was picking up so many unidentified objects is that, prior to this event, it was only looking for larger objects, and has since tweaked its radar so as to detect smaller objects. You\u2019ve got to be kidding me. I get this picture of a commander at NORAD approaching the big screen radar controls and turning one large dial 90-degrees to the right to bring in smaller objects and immediately exclaiming, \u201cWTF!\u201dThe last \u201cUFO\u201d Joe had shot down was reportedly an octagonal balloon-like vehicle with string-like appendages hanging down. It was drifting slowly along at 20,000 feet over Lake Huron. And the first $400,000 missile fired by an Air Force plane missed it. How is that possible?!! A supersonic jet with state-of-the-art technology and guided missiles missed an unmanned, unarmed, slow-moving balloon?! Why not just sidle up to it and pop it? A bi-plane and pilot with a .22 rifle could have brought it down. For that matter, why not just tether the thing, capture it, and bring it down intact? If we knew it posed no threat and really wanted to learn about it, wouldn\u2019t it be better to have the object on the ground and intact?Beam me up, Scotty, there\u2019s no intelligent life among the democrat government !@!@!",

That's a positive outcome to the world, but especially to NATO as it loses Russia as a rival for the coming decade so it can focus on China and it's stopping it's expansionism, and the comparative costs are low compared to NATO actually fighting the war itself. While this might be deemed 'good' I think it's morally reprehensible. Every day the war could have been over sooner is day casualties on both sides could have been prevented. And I don't really buy into them being scared of escalation, not after their initial open threat if Russia moved to using biological, chemical or nuclear weapons. So if it's not fear, it was at least a lack of interest or moral obligation to support those who share our values.. or worse, and the suffering of Ukraine has been deemed an acceptable strategic 'loss' for as long as they are bleeding Rasha out.

Still, Germany is an even higher donor there relative to the EU funding.And while that's something which might make some people feel good about Germany, all it does for me is feel bad about the other countries doing less since even Germany is not really doing what they should have done a year ago ( free the Leopards took way to long ).",

    "comment": "*The US has not come forward why they are spraying their populations, and balloon gate just a distraction?  Explosions, looting, sabotage, what are the reasons? Was it all planned?  Is it an attack on Acts2:44,45 businesses?*  Some want to empower you with information and knowledge, so you can create and build, but others want to dominate and control.  *Rome said that they were going to destroy property and they are.  Attacks on cement plants, stores and fuel supplies are all happening, like the huge explosion in South Africa, ports and warehouses lit on fire.*  The Catholic Church is the Church that rides the Roman Empire(that is why it is called theRoman Catholic Church).  *The Pope is the King of the Vatican City State that controls the Roman Empire.  The Pope has 666 in Latin on his crown (vicarivs filii dei).  Revelation 17,18 describes his system including what the leaders wear(Scarlet-Catholic Cardinals and Purple-Catholic Bishops, and the British Empire(UK) wears these colours also).  Revelation mentions that this organization is responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth.  WW2 was a war to hide their being exposed.*  They attacked Acts2:44,45 of the Bible, just as they are now.  *The Pope claims to be the head of God's Church and the British Royals claim they are the head of the Church, but neither are, but Jesus(Yeshua) of the Bible is the only head of the Church and all others are brothers.  Those who follow the two legs of the Roman Empire are destroyed by God's Kingdom as mentioned in Daniel 2:44,45, Daniel12:4.  Daniel showed that Rome split in to two Empires Catholic and Protestant.  The lies of the Roman Church could no longer be hidden, so Rome decided to take control of the opposition.*  The Bible says that the true Sabbath is a sign and reinforces the covenant between God and his true followers.  *Protestantism and Catholicism both have the same fake Sabbath, called the Lord's day, to mislead people in to thinking the Lord mentioned is God and that it is his Sabbath, but it is not.  According to their own writings the  Lord's Day comes the day after God's Sabbath.  So people break God's law every week by observing the wrong day.*  That they say the Lord's Day comes after the Sabbath does not mean that that is true though.  *In Revelation God warns his people to come out of this blasphemous organization(*Revelation 18:4 is there an other Church riding the Roman Empire?*).*  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic and started WW2.  The same things are happening under the guise of a corona virus pandemic and they are starting WW3.  *Is Taiwan part of America?  Taiwan has been recognized by most Nations of the world as part of China, including America(US).*  Search the one China policy!  *The US has over 700 military bases around the world.  Does the West/Rome/UK own every thing on earth? God said they would rule for 1260 years, which ended in 1790.  Canada says it's laws apply to the moon also, so the G7 seven heads of Revelation claim to own and control every thing.*  China and Russia observe Acts2:44,45 and The two legs of Rome are against them by all means.  *Revelation 20 says Gog Magog war comes after 1000 years of peace.  May be every one missed that 1000 years of peace by the two world wars when Rome tried to exterminate Jews and Acts2:44,45(search operation Barbarossa!).*  God has chosen a day when he will judge the earth in righteousness and those opposing him will be like excrement strewn upon the earth.  Many military men will be the food of birds.  There will be pillars of smoke and fire, with heat so hot that a person's flesh will melt from their body before they have a chance to fall to the ground(Bible book of Joel).  *There needs to be a UN fact finding mission to see why there was a massing of Catholic Poland's military and Italy's Air force on the Polish border before the Ukraine war started!  Now that is the site of the biggest military conglomeration in that area.  I feel that Rome(Italy) started the war from the border of Poland.  Poland had said that the military was there because Russia was sending migrants from the Middle East there.  Why would the Italian Airforce be there for migrants?  Migrants have a legal right under International law to immigrate from a war zone.  Poland and Italy are Catholic and Zellensky claims that Ukraine is becoming a Catholic State.  They have already banned the Orthodox Church there.  NATO's Ukraine proxy government has banned the Russian language(which many only speak), banned all opposition parties, so how can this be called a fight for Democracy? Two regions which refused to be part of the new Ukraine voted to separate in to their own Countries, but Ukraine/NATO would not recognize them.*  Britain installed two Prime Ministers which were not elected, and is instituting a 15 minute from home travel limit, with out a permit.  *Is that freedom?*  (king)Charles is an illegal heir.  *WW2 was to hide the German Nazi that married the British Queen, instead of her taking his name, he took hers.  Philip was a German, but renounced that to become a Greek citizen, and from there moved to Britain.  He became a Duke out of thin air and then a prince, and then married Queen Elizabeth.*  Catholicism and Protestantism are two legs of the Roman Beast.  *The Roman Empire made (false)Christianity the State religion after trying unsuccessfully to exterminate the true believers.  The Emperor brought in all the idols of false worship in to the church as Saints.  The Pope claims to be a celibate successor of the Bible's Apostle Peter, but according to the Bible, Peter had a mother in law, and if you have a mother in law, you have a wife.  Jesus healed Peter's wife's mother.  Paul said he chose to remain single, but could take a wife, just as Peter and the other Apostle's had done.* The whole system is a fraud, that kills to stay in power.  *Remember Britain and Australia lifting all corona restrictions, only to completely lock you down?  They made a (quasi)law no talking to strangers.  Think!*  The Vatican took trillions of dollars from Countries around the world to the Vatican Bank.  That loss of money will cause a deep recession/depression.  *That is why in Revelation/Apocalypse 18:6, it says, pay her back double for her crimes(read it!).*  America remember 1776!  *How are Protestant and Catholic Nations in a military alliance to wage war on all Countries against that alliance?*  Rome at war with all humanity?  *This is the very doctrine of the Roman General Marya.  When Rome says they need to get back to the Marian traditions, that means having a military continuously at war with your own people or other Nations, as prescribed by the Roman General Marya.*  If a child with in the Roman Empire expresses sentiments of wrongfulness about the System, then the child's mother will be told to give the child these poisonous berries or your whole family will be wiped out(British Royals grow a variety of poisonous plants).  They say the child has corona virus(corona-is Latin for crown-it means government, government-means govern your ment (govern your mind)).  Wake up and think before your dead!  *NATO is behind the war in Ukraine, as former German Chancellor Angela Merkel mentioned, and now Germany declared they and Europe are at war with Russia (Operation Barbarossa \u00b2?).*  People make movies showing frightening future circumstances, not because they are desirous of those realities, but to warn.  *Satanism by design, rears its head to guide people back to the supposed security of Christianity.*  Most wars are perpetrated by Rome alligned Nations, including both world wars.  *I'm not Russian, quit attacking them!*  Is the US using sulfer dioxide, iron oxide and silver iodide to create weather warfare? *Against it's own people?*  Is the air traffic control problem to hide the identity of who is spraying you?  *In the past, the US attacked Communists(Acts2:44,45) in Vietnam, saying if they don't attack them there, then we will have to fight them in California.  The US has sanctions against many, if not all Communist States.  G7= (Revelation's 7heads) Christian Nations, and NATO is a Christian military alliance.*  Look at the Ukraine flag in Revelation!  *Some Bibles say hyacinth blue and sulfer yellow, and some say turquoise blue and sulfur yellow.*   Residential building bombing in Ukraine was not Russia, according to Alexy Arestovich Senior Ukrainian adviser.  Alexy quit and possibly the helicopter crash in Ukraine is to hide that?  *NATO using lies to attack Acts2:44,45(Russia and China...).*  CBDCs and Crypto are not the same.  UK preparing for Martial Law.  *Church and State are killing by looks or name, just like in the movie Terminator.*  Search Operation Barbarossa  Search Scott Ritter.  *The US has banned Jews from US military jets(now trying to frame Israel for a war?).*   US AirForce General Mike Minahand says probably US/NATO war with China in 2025 and says practice aiming for the head.  *Americans too!?*  Spy balloon? *Or balloon collecting evidence of US war crimes against it's own people?  Spraying them.  Spraying breifly stopped after balloon hype, but then started again.  People can see the planes spraying and there are even pictures of the planes.*  NATO shuttering the internet to hide this message.  *The eating bugs story, is an attack businesses and products.*  A US Colonel says the US has biolabs in Ukraine. Much evidence that NATO started the war between Russia and Ukraine, and uses faux weapons.  Fake Christians fight for Revelation18:6, in stead of against. The war could have been stopped a week and a half after, but NATO blocked it.  Implanted microchip, vaccine passport payment system is here. Revelation 13:18.  Vote to disarm NATO, and take away the tax exemption of the false churches!  *NATO using poison gas and about to use depleted Uranium munitions.* ;+(;+!+",

    "comment": "Fuhrer; In German it means leader and it refer to A. Hitler who had total control over everything. A word from him could mean praise or as it did in most cases it meant death.  Ten of thousands in his name went to war and turn everything his army touch into ash. It was not possible to do as he did if it was not the average person in Germany to go along with him. Then even if they did not like what he did, if they said anything being sent to a camp was a one way ticket to death.In this day an age many other can also take that name as Fuhrer rather they want it or not. Leaders of countries that have total control also have total control on who lives or dies.In Mother Russia that once enjoyed if only briefly a form of freedom is now rule by a world renown leader that can also claim the title as Fuhrer. Fuhrer Putin fits him, as he has total control of that vast country. He alone can send death from the skies upon Ukraine cities. He does picks the target to be attack and then smiles as the targets are turn to rumble.Not only that he expects that his military would have crush the Ukraine within days of his attack. When that fail he did what any good war load would have done, send in more troops. Slowly Fuhrer Putin is winning his war. Ukraine defenders are being killed. Since Fuhrer Putin has 100 of thousands more then the Ukraine defenders he will win in the long run.As of this day it has been estimated that nearly 200,000 good Russian soldiers have died. But one thing for sure is that the Ukraine's army is running out of fighters as well as ammo. Fuhrer Putin war is only a matter a short time when all of Ukraine will be in the hands of Fuhrer Putin. Once that is done The Fuhrer will prepared to retake back of what Russia lost at the end of the Cold War.The winners write history.It is a war that will decide who will rule in the rest of this century.Just saying,,",

Maybe they could have explained to her about what exactly is a television or help her seek professional help ... I mean it's funny at first but imagine her wandering around in Salem to search for a man who doesn't exist ... I feel bad for her because she was practically one of the best women joey dated ... if not for this weird thing she might actually be the one to end up with him .... till then could have kept her as a recurring character like Janice .... but that's just an opinion",

The only character that has in script to be and evil laughing guy is pretty much only Chandler.The rest never really smiles to the comedy they are doing.At 1:54 you can clearly see that when she smiles, she even turns her head away from the camera. If you wonder why, it is because she is not supposed to burst in laughter during the scenes. In sitcoms, with the annoying clapping audience on the backgroud, the actors just do not smile on the scene. That is kinda the purpose of the whole type of show. They act seriously, we laugh. So, what Jennifer is doing in this video is breaking the character. And I repeat, they broke it too many times as someone noticed how joeys shirt is way more wet from one throwing scene to another. Probably they all were smiling/breaking the character too much",

However, when I am watching it over and over again, I start to be pretty irritated by the way how the creators depict asocial scientists. Do you really think that such intelligent people with highly diverse interests would be interested in playing infantile computer games, or visiting ComicCons? And when do they actually study and read scientific literature? Being a scientist myself (and quite a successful one), I know that absorbing new information in my field(s) is a very time-consuming matter. But all I see here is that these four guys are either playing those infantile games, or they are eating Thai foods. I suspect that Mr. Lorre and Mr. Prady mistook asocial scientists for childish computer geeks. WHICH IS NOT THE SAME THING. Their behaviour may be funny but the depiction of their lives is quite silly for anyone who turns on their brain while watching this series.",

He probably grew up around black people who bullied and picked on him. Alot of black kids are raised by their parents to hate white people, because our ancestors enslaved their ancestors.",

    "comment": "I agree Giovanna, but I think this guy who massacred all those blacks was most likely the victim of racism by blacks. Something in his past caused him to have this hatred against blacks and snap on them. He most likely grew up around blacks and was picked on and beaten up by them. The leftist media won't report this, but blacks are the most racist people on the planet. They are raised by their parents to hate white people, because our ancestors enslaved theirs. I'm not trying to justify what he did, but there is more to the story than the media is telling us.",

Your prisons are privately owned so it\u2019s in their interest for more people to be incarcerated whether they are guilty or not. You can go to jail for a max of three years for rape, but 5 years to life for tax evasion. And that\u2019s just what comes to mind",

What checks on mental health would work with USA gun laws, and what checks would people like the NRA be willing to accept given the paranoia about the government? Could it actually be that wanting to own assault rifles is a sign of poor mental health\u2026Your point about knives is laughable and should be obvious with anyone who has a third of a functioning brain (clue, there\u2019s a reason armies use guns rather than knives).",

Fewer legal guns means fewer illegal guns, fewer guns overall means less need to carry or use them legally or illegally. Stricter gun laws means stricter punishments for illegal ownership which means less likely for criminals to use them. Stricter gun laws make it harder for mentally unbalanced to get them as only certain criminals will know where to get them. I know simple logic is beyond you but still, give your head a wobble.",

    "comment": "@Nicholas Smith another key point i wanna add right away. getting rid of guns doesn\u2019t solve the problem that is clearly everything to do with mental health. answer me this, after you ban all guns hypothetically, will you ban knives because of mass stabbings? maybe lock them up in stores like england? will you then ban all vehicles because of people plowing into crowds? how bout banning bombs, oh wait those are banned and people still make them cause they\u2019re crazy. how bout the guy that built his own tank in the united states (killdozer) you gonna ban komatsu bulldozers and register big sheets of metal? and please identify how that was a logical fallacy. all countries have problems with illegal guns that\u2019s a fact. my point being that laws don\u2019t stop killers. i\u2019d rather have a gun on me when a shooter walks in than a law to protect me. these things more often than not happen in states that have strict gun control because shooters are cowards who use gun control + obedient citizens to their advantage. when they do happen in states that have lenient gun policy it\u2019s always a gun free zone. Uvalde in Texas was at a school for instance, but please research the Texas church shooting. shooter walked in and more people than i can count unloaded on him before he could kill many people. maybe got 1 or 2 if that. shootings like this don\u2019t happen in my state because anyone can carry concealed or unconcealed without a license as long as they meet age requirement. why would a shooter shoot here when they can go a state over where it\u2019s almost impossible for someone to defend themselves or as i said they\u2019ll choose a school because we make them vulnerable. and the cops at schools don\u2019t count as protection, US supreme court has ruled Law Enforcement has no legal responsibility to protect a citizen from harm. Government getting more and more tyrannical and airing shootings everyday helps their agenda. also you ignored my questions, please logically explain to me how you\u2019re safer from a law than actually protecting yourself with a firearm. laws can and will be broken. you can\u2019t erase knowledge of gunsmithing, you can go to your local hardware store and find everything you need to make a firearm. not the best but it will work. and 3D printing? i love how you ignored these key points. oh and it\u2019s not because we \u201cdon\u2019t engage our brain\u201d it\u2019s called rights dude, firearms were written into our constitution. just like speech religion etc. clearly we have different opinions here. you can be happy being defenseless because of your government when they or someone else comes for you. i\u2019ll be happy to be armed when that day comes, be it the government enforcers at my door or a mugger on the street, or a mass shooter in a store. Like i said in my country i can\u2019t rely on Law Enforcement to protect me anyway. and even if i did rely on them, when seconds count LE is minutes away.",

So either you have no idea what you are really talking about or just interested in promoting the arsclauwun black oppression narrative.And nope, you said, Maga types, that's a stereotype and includes no less than 70 million people, So you ain't so innocent after all, you too think like the shooter.

To quote the FBI annual report: The number of homicides reached an all-time high of 24,703 homicides in 1991, then fell rapidly to 15,522 homicides by 1999. The number of homicides increased steadily from the early 1950s until the mid-1970s. Between 1999 and 2008, the number of homicides remained relatively constant, ranging from a low of 15,552 homicides in 1999 to a high of 17,030 homicides in 2006. These homicide numbers were still below those reported in the 1970s, when the number of reported homicides rose above 20,000 (reaching 20,710 in 1974). And during the same time period, 52.5% were black and 45.3% white according to the FBI report. So, we can securely say your first statistic is absolute bullshit and comes from ignorance. The last time that many Americans were murdered, a bunch of lazy-ass southerners fought for their ability to own people.As for the rest, your logic is still flawed because being a maga type is your label.... Maga-tism. Rofl! It just so happens that it is now a noun synonymous with illiterate morons who couldn't type a coherent sentence to save their life.

Beginners focus on analysis, but professionals operate in a three dimensional space. They are aware of trading psychology their own feelings and the mass psychology of the markets. <Meanwhile tradiing bitcoin options provide excellent opportunities for investors aiming to maximize gains while limiting their losses.

The truth is that the market remains unpredictable especially in the long-term. Despite the heavy outflows, Bitcoin still managed to promptly recover, this recovery demonstrated Bitcoin\u2019s strength despite being stress tested against highly volatile and unfavorable market conditions. Could this outcome be a sign that the market is ready for a bigger recovery? The obvious answers is yes despite how long it might take, it is very important to stay ahead of the market by trading with the right strategy.

It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market.

The index trades at 4000 some odd dollars right now. And the ETF version trades at 400 some odd dollars. But it's basically an identical reflection of the actual S&P index. But that's the only thing he's ever mentioned to invest in which I can understand why because in the last 100 years it's had an average of 10% return per year. It's a very very safe investment.

For investors, what's probably most attractive is the possibility of life-changing returns. Don't worry, you're not late to the crypto party. We're likely still in the very early innings, leaving you with lots of time to put money to work and learn about this burgeoning market. If you're new to crypto then my advise is that you trade with the guidance of an expert. I have learned from alot of Youtubers especially my mentor  REALSOURCEINVESTMENT , who taught me how to make trade and increase my portfolio to 20 btc lately",

    "comment": "The regular lending rates on FTX are quite good compared to most banks, but they fluctuate by the hour (and also intra-hour, but you're generally not paid for that). Meanwhile staking is a set yearly amount that seldom changes, but then you have to find a good entry and bare the risk that entails. On the other hand, I consider the opportunity cost of not owning crypto these days to be much of a much higher risk. That is to say, I think _not _owning crypto is far more risky than owning it, due to various things not limited to stupid fiscal policies and Fed money printing. So the best is owing it, trading and investing with it, I learned that from a crypto expert from EXTREMETOPPERS I've made tons of profits btw",

    "comment": "Credit score is not something used in all countries though. In France, they determine if you are eligible to get a loan (e.g., to buy a house) based on the ratio between your salary, your expenses and your savings. Basically, if every month you 'burn' all your money, you're perceived as riskier than someone earning less but consistently making deposits to a saving account. I feel in the US people tend to buy things they don't need with money they don't have... The only times I feel one should need a credit is when buying 'big' things (house, car, etc.). Not for a TV.

It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC. We were already on shaky footing with historically low volume and almost pure whale pumps,narrowly avoiding a long-term bear market. More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 3.5 BTC from day trad!ng with Liberton Corp insights and charts. His been one step ahead of other analysis..Stick with BTC/ETH/BNB/ADA/MATIC...",

The big institutions getting in is the catalyst that will launch us into the stratosphere.  Most people don't like change but after the change is made they grow used to it and it becomes a non issue usually because their fears never materialize.   The projects that initiated the process of regulation have not been ruined, they got involved in setting guidelines and helping the regulators understand the crypto space.

For investors, what's probably most attractive is the possibility of life-changing returns. Don't worry, you're not late to the crypto party. We're likely still in the very early innings, leaving you with lots of time to put money to work and learn about this burgeoning market. If you're new to crypto then my advise is that you trade with the guidance of an expert.

I\u2019m currently an N.A waiting to get certified because of covid and stuff but I support myself and my grandma. I don\u2019t have anyone to turn to for help, I\u2019ve been trying to save but I can\u2019t because of bills and renting my apartment and everything. But this, literally helped me look to a brighter future. My grandma is crippled so she cannot do work or anything. Most people have parents to turn to but I don\u2019t talk to my mom or dad. This literally helped me so much because since I met *mitnickSystems\u277eCom*  the real issue I have about debt was solved in some weeks am sure before Feb of my birthday I will be a homeowner.",

Most newbies and would-be investors often undermine and most often neglect the importance of technical analysis with regards to investing. Technical analysis overly predicts the movement of asset prices regardless of what is happening in the wider or broader market. Essentially, the process involves studying the paths of a particular asset movement in the past so as to establish a sustainable pattern that can be used to predict future movements or better still get an investment advisor who'd guide you and help you manage your portfolio just like my boss back then, He was working with an IA Roger James and i would bet he still does. I can boldly recommend him because i've witnessed his performance first hand. he's the real deal.",

But it\u2019s only true if the market will recognize the value of the company before you sell. If you buy something for less than its worth, and before you investment horizon is up the stock hasn\u2019t appreciated, it doesn\u2019t matter how good the \u201cdeal\u201d you got was. You still operated at a loss. The more efficient the market is, the more probable it is that a value investment will pay off. Conversely, high market efficiency means that value investments are harder to find. In either case, the practical application of this philosophy is perhaps inherently limited. I say this as someone who is heading into valuation as a profession. Not that I am more knowledgeable than Mr. Buffet, but we cannot reduce a stock investment strategy to pure theory when price fluctuations ultimately matter for those who plan to cash in. For someone like Buffet who has virtually limitless wealth, holding forever is perfectly fine. For most of us, we will sell within the foreseeable future.",

If you buy put options on gold and with your influence make my theory on money known provoking the gold market crash you would become rich. Being everything else the same a country with no gold is wealthier than a country with gold that protects the mineral inside a vault. Being everything else the same imagine a country with a baker, a fishmonger and a singer with no gold and another with a baker, a fishmonger and a guard to protect gold inside a vault. Which one lives better? Which one is wealthier? The country with no gold is wealthier because the baker and fishmonger get entertained by the singer for their money but the country with gold have to work to pay the guard to protect a mineral that offers no wellbeing or wealth because is useless inside a vault.  An analogy would be an innocent kid after saving his pocket money buys a bicycle and his father tells him that he can store the bicycle in a garage unused to sell it in the future, but the rent of the garage would cost him some of his pocket money or he can use and enjoy the bicycle. Which option would the kid choose? There is not benefit in buying to sell because no value is added. Do you understand? The gold becomes wealth when is used, sparing the cost of protection. Because gold is increasingly more expensive to dig out as there is less underground and is increasingly cheaper as there is more on offer overground there would be a point when nobody would be mining the mineral. How much cost the taxpayers to protect gold? Cryptocurrencies are a number but money is transferable debt, a number and a name. Who would sell last? capitalist or communist?",

Don't sell for fear of losing money and dont buy for fear of missing out. Second Principle - Understand the business. Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cashflow statment, management, competitive advantage, industry averages, etc....Third Concept - Margin of Safety. Buy stocks at a price that will minimize risk of a loss. Buy the stock below the price of what you think it is worth. If you think the business is worth 150 buy stock price below 150. This way if company goes out of business, you get your money back when the business sells assets to pay of debt. Understanding the business is the key to investing like Buffet. Without understanding you will fail to adhere to First and Third Principles.",

Sometimes it's not that they failed but rather they were bought out and destroyed. Sometimes those products don't reflect what the public wants. I spent an afternoon looking at new cars five years. I discovered that of the three American cars I looked at they thought I wanted a jet fighter or the starship Enterprise.

The Intelligent Investor is an excellent book albeit that value investing is much more profitable for the likes of  Graham and Buffet who take or took a controlling or significant, influential stake in a company than it is for the common individual investor who buys a few shares. With that said, there are great tidbits in the video, including the tip about researching a stock before looking at its price. I'm not sure how to do that exactly, but I may try.",

To be honest, I do not think most have the fortitude, discipline, or what it takes to really dig into a company to determine its value.  At E.F. Hutton while listening to Don Morrison my broker in Stuart, Florida explain how it works to this then 19 year old in 1973. I remember watching the ticker across the room in Orange!  Had to use a Voltron Machine to check the price of a stock.  For Don, it was in the fundamentals that would give you long-term results.  My old friend is gone now.

I always wonder if you realize you are desensatizing folks that might NEED to keep their guards up because maybe just maybe the guy popping out of the bushes isn't looking to just scare them. Maybe just maybe  he's going to harm them. It happens all the time. How would you feel if someone scared the fuck out of you and your girl or your child or mom and that kept scaring them in A bad bad way. And you were supposed to protect them but instead of murdering the assailant before anything bad happened you gave them that extra step. Cuz they thought it's probably just the bushman.",

Key passes means nothing, it's completely subjective unless it ended with a goal.You claimed mbappe had a bigger impact even though messi has more key passes and chances created.Fair criteria is that you claim he is the best of all time, no player in that category has a season and a half not playing well. They sometimes have a few games maybe at most, usually only a game here and there but not that long. Ronaldo nazario had multiple seasons with single digit goals only. Zidane almost always had single digit goals and hardly any assists compared to messi. Pele in 1971 had 7 goals in 40 games. Maradona once got 13 goals in 31 games. George best once got 6 goals in 23 games. All full seasons.His good seasons were in one leagueAlmost like ronaldo, with almost all his good seasons being in la liga. a farmers leagueLa liga is not a farmers league.unproven in others, proven to be wrong in a few seasons at PSG.'So you go from several to one and a half and now a few?

    "comment": "@Dante well the Messi had two great assists and one average assist. That is a good impact. Considering he also had more key passes and chances created compared to mbappe.How is it a fair criteria? Every player will have bad seasons. Including the best. That doesn\u2019t make his good seasons any worse considering how many of them he had.\u201cNo players win games alone\u201dHe had the best influence in the game. If mbappe won the WC and Messi didn\u2019t score that last goal, everyone would\u2019ve said he carried the final.Well that\u2019s just wrong. He isn\u2019t performing badly in 2022 season. In the 22/23 season, he hs a higher GA than games played (25 goals 18 assists in 31 games). That\u2019s not terrible stats.What is that supposed to mean? How do you know he didn\u2019t dropcform after moving to PSG? And where the hell do you get that definition? He is playing at an age a lot of players retire at and you expect him to play at his best ? He\u2019s played 15+ good years. That\u2019s an arbitrary criteria.Rooney peaked early? Messi at 22 won a ballondor and proceeded to win 4 in a row. Even before that people were saying he was going to be the best everChemistry comes from playing with the player and team not both of them being great. Great players can not fit into a squad or not get along with some players and so on. That\u2019s how football works, not just two good players being shoved into a team. That\u2019s why PSG has great players but isn\u2019t a great team. Chemistry and team work doesn\u2019t come from buying 100 m players.It wasn\u2019t a season and a half, it was one season. He regained form near the beginning of the season before the WC. He has more GA than games this season. That\u2019s not \u201cunproven\u201d.Yes but didn\u2019t you call it a farmers league? Messi also spent his best years there but u complain it\u2019s a farmers league. Messi is also proving it now in PSG.https://olympics.com/en/news/pele-goals-scored-football-career-how-manyMessi doesn\u2019t have half his skill! Is that why he replicated Maradonas best goal at 20? And scored many more similar goals in his entire career? And has way more goals and assists?Messi doesn\u2019t NEED skills. If you consider skills on the ball to be actual football skills then you are mistaken. Messi can do body feigned and so on, making him the best dribbler in the world. Simple football is better and more efficient than flashy tricks. Cruyff said it too.And who has a better goal ratio? More assists? Better shot conversion? And so much more. Ronaldo isn\u2019t even better at scoring when Messi can get 91 in a year and Ronaldo can\u2019t get close (in your same so called farmers league and in a similarly good club) And did you just call the euro close to WC? Italy , the euro winners , couldn\u2019t even qualify for the World Cup. And a weaker national team yet this year their national team was arguably better than Argentina. Messi has more trophies than Ronaldo as well. All you can do is name super specific stats . Messi has better dribbling shooting playmakingAre you stupid? Unbalancing players is literally what the tricks are for. Either you unbalance or use your speed. And again, simple football is better than tricky flashy skills. Messi has one of the best passing and finishing in the world. You just say Messi can\u2019t do anything even though he can.

You just expect him to perform at his prime levels every season which is impossible for any player.Messi had to carry barca to the UCL knockouts those yearsAre you stupid? I meant beginning of this season, not last season.Man still dropped form. Yes he was better than Messi at PSG but as you said they were both \u201cpassed it\u201d. Is Messi unable to have a bad season once in 15 or more years?Yes they all had health issues. Players are still retiring at Messis age, look at Rooney, he was retired by Messis age and Messi was winning a WC.Or maybe it\u2019s just your bad definition ?You know you still need chemistry with the midfield and other attacker right? Neymar plays on the other wing. Again, you pull it out of your ass. Even you said his stats were \u201caverage\u201d. He had one average season and you call him overrated.You know Ronaldo also won almost all his ballondor s in the farmers league you\u2019re talking about? And Pel\u00e9 was actually playing in a farmers league and counting his friendly goals?! Maradona did not play with average teams. Messi is just a better Maradona. Ronaldo won more for his nation, while playing for a much much better nation than Argentina. How do you prove he had more skill? Messi is the best dribbler.C Ronaldo has fewer trophies than Messi. Messi is way more skilled. Messi is better in almost everything compared to him.Zidane had way more skills? Messis dribbler is the best; and he\u2019s top in almost everything.

He regained it near the start of the season, that's why so many people were predicting argentina to win the WC.a year and a half too long for a so called best everSays who? Ronaldo also took a dip in form after moving to juventus. And messi is also getting older, you expect him to perform top level every season of his life? The other greatest players retired much earlier or moved to US or asian clubs to reitre.Several means different things depending on where you go, it means more than one here.In english, it is defined as more than two in every single definition you can find.He also plays with one of his ex teammates which means it's way less of an alien environment. One? Lmao, and so what? Everyone takes dips in form, a one season dip is not terrible for someone who has been performing for his entire career. A 25 GA is not horrible, but since you're so used to seeing him get 80 per season you think he's overrated.

    "comment": "@falcr My initial argument was that Messi scored so many goals was because he played in a farmers league meaning he wouldn't score so many goals in another team or league so lauding him for what isn't an accurate representation of his true level is the reason I responded initially.Whether or not the other teams in the league are any good is a separate point to  whether the league is a farmers league or not, it all depends on whether it has a dominant team or two who farm that league. If the team he plays for is so much better generally speaking than all but one other team that they dominate the league it doesn't matter how good the other teams are because the natural result of playing for a dominant team is that his stats go up more than they would elsewhere, he's playing with better players in his own squad, better in fact than most other great teams in Europe because of the factors I've previously stated.Going back a hundred years is completely relevant because it shows exactly how dominant they've been both in domestic and European games. They've had more xed results over the years against English teams, they edge it of course but that should be expected given those same factors i mentioned previously. Even in the last 20 yes English sides have managed to beat them both at times so that shows they have been better than them until they farmed them for their best players. So because Athletic Bilbao best Manutd once when Man it's were a decent side that means la Liga is better than PL in your logic? So what happened in 2006/7 when Liverpool best Barca? They finished 21 points behind leaders in EPL Does that mean PL was better than La Liga then using same logic?I'm no Brit but I do think the average PL team is better than the average La Liga team, this is played out by the fact that even when English clubs win in Europe and best Spanish clubs, they still don't dominate their own league like the two Spanish clubs do and the fact there's  more widespread winners in the EPL.Man city have dominated recently sure, because they've got way more money and have a top manager. Klopp and Liverpool have rivalled them in the last few years with just Klopps ability to get good players cheap and make them play well  and It's rivalled them for a period before that as well as a win for Chelsea in between as well but yes in the last few years having a nation state owned club does turn things a bit although not to the same degree as in Spain, Newcastle can be expected up there soon as well.The PL has not been decided by February in the last few years, there was one point in it in two of the last 4 and 2 different clubs won it in the other two. It's hardly a cake walk for one club.",

I've seem Messi do little to nothing in countless games and then pop up and score a good goal and everyone claiming he's the greatest. It's nonsense, if you actually watch him he just does hardly anything but wander around until space opens up, which is partly a skill but he's not working for the team in the same way the others do.

Looking at that history shows it's spread out with several teams winning it and fairly evenly other than a couple of periods.  A farmers league is a league dominated by one or two teams, you can add four or more otherwise you could use that logic to say a league spread out by 20 teams who share the wind is a farmers league if they are the only teams to ever win it. No, the general idea is that it's one or two teams that just completely dominate which they do. Having a gap between the two top leagues and the rest makes it a farmers league of leagues, but it doesn't influence whether the 2 top leagues are farmers leagues within themselves.",

    "comment": "@oeoeoeoeoeoeoeoe bigger impact is the goals you score plus assists to goals and how good they were, Mbappe was the best player of the tournament without any doubt.Ronaldo was injured for most of his career, when he wasn't he was scoring for fun.Zidane was a playmaker , not a forward like Messi etc..., These days all you kids talk about is how many assists and goals players get and that's how you judge everything. Is Messi better than Maldini at defending because he scored more goals? Is he better than xavi at passing possession? No, and he's not better than Zidane in skills.Pele scored 9 goals in 71 and he was injured that year, get your facts straight  and he also had 12 seasons where he scored more goals than games!Maradona never played a season with 31 games so your facts are wrong again, prior to playing in Italy he always scored more than one in 2 and at Boca was as good as  anyone, in Italy at that time the philosophy of Italians was defensive play except for Milan so scoring goals was much harder and the top scorers never did as well there. He still got just under 1 in 3 there which considering he's not a striker and on a weak team is remarkable.George Best scored 1 in 2 every year from when he was at his best to when alcohol stopped him so your stat is wrong again.No not the same as Ronaldo, he succeeded in doing well and winning in several nations, Messi only one, not comparable.La Liga is a farmers league for two teams, they win the league nearly every year meaning no other team can compete with them realistically for titles.Several, a few are the same, more than one which is what it's been, a year and a half of not performing like the so called goat you claim he is.",

    "comment": "@oeoeoeoeoeoeoeoe The most goals scored in a specified period is 1,279 by Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Brazil), known as Pele, from 7 September 1956 to 1 October 1977 in 1,363 games.  Even if you count the so called official matches he's way ahead on goals per game and he played in an era with terrible fouls and protection and health care.Let that sink in, his best year was 1959 with 126Mbappe was way more influential than Messi both in final and tournament, easily the best player.Messi has 14 assists and 13 goals in 22/23 season, that's not goat levels.His stats show his form dropped after the move to PSG, that's how I know, I don't expect his best age but I do expect better than he has done for the few years he's been at PSG if he is the goat.As I said some players have different career lengths, Rooney was playing as good as anyone at 18, not 22 like Messi, but the age they started isn't relevant, it's just genetics and some players can play longer than others.Both Messi and Neymar proved they could play together at Barca so that boots your chemistry theory out the door, the team dominates the league, the team is doing well, there's no issues with chemistry.Messi didn't replicate Maradona goal, it was completely different, Maradona did it through tricks and skill, Messi just uses his size to unbalance players, there's nothing more to his game, show me Messi performing the same touches, volley, dribbles and tricks as Maradona, watch Maradona videos to see his abilities, Messi was never like that, his entire game is built on using his size to unbalance players he runs at, nothing more. He has more goals and assist because he played in a team that was built to use him that way, Maradona had to play further back in lesser teams where he had to do more in the build up play and got fouled way more back then and played less games. No comparison at all, Maradona was way more skilled, even Ronaldinho was way more skilled in that type of thing. Trick and touches and volleys and all the other skills in football contribute to how great a player is, simple football is all the things that are possible to do, if it creates openings, if you put Messi in the teams of the other he wouldn't be successful the same way as his game is built on himself and it takes a great team built around him to be successful, he doesn't have the other skills required to make the chances possible. Cruyff was the same type of player as the likes of Zidane etc, it was all touches and tricks and great passing.It makes sense Messi has better assists as hes played in a dominant possession team which creates more chances for higher assist stats whilst Ronaldo had to do it more on his own in a new league in a team not built around him and still got more goals in all comps, one year doesn't mean a thing to overall greatness, Ronaldo got the most goals.Yes I did call EC close to WC, it is, except for Brazil and Argentina the standard team is as good as WC and the worst teams are better than the WC worst teams. Italy not getting to one WC somehow means the competition through history isn't as good\ud83e\udd26 they won the most world cups after Brazil but because they don't get there one year that means the WC isn't so good in your logic\ud83d\ude48.You said earlier that teams aren't great based on players but now you say Italy better than Argentina, sorry that's not true, Argentina are clearly better as the won the world cup, facts are facts.Messi played in one team, that was built for him since childhood in the same league, obviously Ronaldo moving around so much in teams not built for him since childhood won't result in the same chance for success, regardless he was still very successful everywhere he went and won all the competitions,  Ronaldo has better dribbling, shooting, heading, skills, Messi is only better at running and using his size to unbalance players.Simple football if successful is good but skillful awe inspiring football when successful is much better, Messi was a one trick pony, boring. Messi finishing is actually not great, if you look at the times he shoots from narrow angles he misses at a higher rate than other top finishers, his goals come from dribbling round the keeper or tap ins from team goals etc, look at his penalty record, his finishing is not great, Ronaldo is better finisher. Messi is also not a great passer, he is adequate but no Pirlo or Scholars or Gerrard.I'm saying he's overrated by his fanboys like you, not that he can't do anything, I'm saying he can't do the other things as good as other players, his skill is based on his size and running at players and unbalancing them he doesn't Excell in anything else. Maradona for example could do anything with a football, Messi can't, that's the point.",

    "comment": "@oeoeoeoeoeoeoeoe 2 good assists and one average assist in a whole world cup isn't legendary by any means, nothing of note. Key passes means nothing, it's completely subjective unless it ended with a goal.Fair criteria is that you claim he is the best of all time, no player in that category has a season and a half not playing well. They sometimes have a few games maybe at most, usually only a game here and there but not that long. His good seasons were in one league, a farmers league with one of the best sides in Europe in a team built around him since childhood, unproven in others, proven to be wrong in a few seasons at PSG.",

    "comment": "@oeoeoeoeoeoeoeoe No I said having the title most assists isnt relevant because you could have all assist just a simple pass so it doesn't really say much about the player, the fact he may or may not have had 2 good assists doesn't change that the rest may be average. If another player gets overall one less assist but his assists are on average better that is more of a credit to him than the guy who got more assists total but to a lesser standard. This is obvious.I expect a player who you claim is the best ever to perform to a higher standard than that every season and at different clubs. That's a fair criteria for the so called best player ever.Messi didn't carry anything, no player wins games alone, the team around him were of a very hight standard just because he's the one the teams built around from childhood which helps him standout doesn't mean he carried them.i meant this season as well, his stats for the whole year of 22 were terrible so the second half of it were also terrible by default.He didn't drop form, his team weren't as dominant as they had been and Messi joined a dominant team. No not a full season, not if he's the best ever.Some players have different playing duration, Rooney was a very young developer and peaked early but finished earlier, players like Ronaldo and Messi last longer but that's not the point, you said the other greatest players retired early and I gave you the reasons why, injury and illness which is not as natural career cycle. No it's a definition but if it makes you feel better I'll say a few years instead.Great players play well and have chemistry with other good players, doesn't matter if they can get stronger chemistry the more they play, he hasn't shown that at PSG, the fact he plays with someone he knows inside out in attack is much more of a indication, they don't play on opposite wings, this isn't 1930's football, players move around and interact these days, especially those kind of players and when a team is totally dominant in their league it's a fast forward to get comfortable with your team mates and their style as they always have the play. There's really no excuse. He's overrated because you are claiming he's the best ever, that title comes to those who don't have an average full season and a half and are completely unproven in a team outside the one built for him since childhood. It makes sense Ronaldo won most his Balondors in Spain as that was where he spent his best years, he also won in other nations and proved he could do it when the team wasn't built for him and the league wasn't the one he'd been in all his life in more competitive leagues.Even if Pele counted his friendly goals(prove that claim), he still scored way more real goals than Messi and he didn't play in a farmers league it was competitive like it is to this day but if you are going to say that about Pele you have to hold Messi to the same standard. He also proved himself at world cups and is without piers in that department.Maradona did play with average teams, Napoli was bottom half team when he went and became the difference to win the title against some of the best sides in history in seria A at that time. He also took an average Argentina to world cup win  with his match winning influence on the team much greater than any other in history. His skills were without pier, he was the most skillful attacking player ever, and could do literally anything with a football. Messi doesn't have half his skill.Ronaldo played in some good sides but not better defensively both styles can win titles, Ronaldo was the greatest and the one who won those titles for his nation, but for injuries he would've won much more. If you want proof he had more skill watch his dribbles and tricks, he was like Ronaldinho and with speed and finishing lethal, Messi just uses his small size to unbalance players, no skill or tricks with the ball.C. Ronaldo has scored more league, Champions League and national team goals than Messi, has won more CLs and with a Wesker national team has won a tournament which is close to WC in level, more European player of the year awards and all whilst playing in several\ud83d\ude06 different leagues, in no way can you say that Messi is better at everything, that's absurd.Zidane has way more skills, the only thing Messi is better at is using his size to unbalance players, he has no ability of a great other than that, Zidane could do anything with a football like Maradona style but not quite as good as him, dribbling tricks, volley, headers, touches and finishing, Messi can't do those things like players such as Zidane, Maradona, Ronaldinho, Baggio, Zola etc.George Best had alcohol addiction, it's a medical psychological condition, regardless he was up there with Maradona as the most gifted player that ever lived, he could beat a player, then continue to beat that player again and again just because he could and then beat everyone else and score, only Maradona I have seen do such things other than him, he was dominant in the league and in Europe and would've been internationally but for playing for a weak team, if his career had gone on longer he would've still been up there but his ability was right up there with anyone.",

    "comment": "@oeoeoeoeoeoeoeoe Your claim wasn't that he made two good assists, your claim was he was the highest assister in the comp, so either he makes the most good assists or the stay isn't relevant.Mbappe s ored and created goals with pure skill, much better skill than Messi, not only did he score more goals but his goals were much better, not tap ins and made by himself.Messi got 14 assists and 11 goals in a whole year, that's not only not great, it's not even good and you are trying to argue it's evidence of being talked about as the best ever.Balon for is a corrupt organisation that awards people because of their reputation rather than actual performance, there were at least 2 times in the Ronaldo Messi era that out performed them yet it was awarded to them anyway. That aside, Barca never underperformed compared to most teams in Europe when he played for them, the players he played with were all internationals and they always competed for trophies, it's not surprising he would still be up for the awards when other players don't have teams designed from childhood around them.He didn't gain any form at the start of the season, you just pulled that out your behind, his stats for the whole year are 14a and 11g which is bang average.Ronaldo was bang at it at Juve even though he was passed it at that point, and Juve weren't completely dominant anymore at that point as other teams had improved. Unlike PSG were it's a one team league.The other greatest players retired earlier because injuries or other health issues restricted them, health and recovery side to the game has massively improved.Several is defined where I live as more than one, which is the case with how long Messi has been at PSG.Playing with an ex teammates who is also someone you played next to your years and in direct connection with as an attacker means your entire argument of him having to acclimatize to a new team is  flawed.  No truly great player goes missing for an entire season, he is not the all time great he's talked about being by fanboys like you, and his move away from Barca has proved it, even in another farmers league where it's easy. Scoring goals in a farmers league you've played in since childhood with a team set up for you doesn't make you the goat, nor does corrupt balondor. Pele scored more goals and won more for his team Maradona did the same with average teams and had more skill, Ronaldo won more for his nation as well and had more skill but was ruined by injury, C Ronaldo in comparison was way more successful, playing in several different teams and winning with all of them including his nation and still rivaled Messi on goals despite that.  Zidane won more despite not having teams built solely for him and had way more skills. George Best had more skill but was ruined by alcohol and playing for a small nation.",

If you want to be included on the talk as the best ever you best be able to perform anywhere you play to the best level, all the other true greats could do that. This is is second season at PSG and it's over half way through, that's more than 1 year as you're claiming, a year and a half too long for a so called best ever.

    "comment": "@Joe As I said previously, even though in the literal sense the use of the term farmers league is to suggest that the league is non professional, literally a group of farmers, that obviously isn't what's meant by the term in this context.  In this scenario we obviously mean that the level of the rest of the clubs compared to the completely dominant club or 2 is so much lower that they might as well be farmers. So on your scenario if you removed Barca and Real Madrid from the league it would certainly be less of a farmers league although I could see Athletico Madrid possibly dominating in their place which would make it a farmers league for them.There's certainly other factors involved like when arguing a comparison with other leagues as we have been doing, showing how one leagues level is higher than others by comparing the top clubs performance against each other in European competition and then the points gap between the top clubs and the rest in their leagues to show who's got it easier.",

I'd say below about 5-6 clubs the drop off is absolutely massive. I'm aware of why certain people(not everyone as you are trying to imply) are upset with me. The reality that the Spanish league is a farmers league for the top 2 does diminish their stature somewhat, which was the point of my original comment, that said it doesn't take away from the true level of those teams and achievements, it just more accurately portrays it.",

    "comment": "@Joe Your point is that because they got the better of the English sides in a 5-10 year period overall in terms of results\ud83d\udc49 means they would make the EPL a farmers league.  This correlation doesn't workI already explained how stats on win loss and draw don't show the complexities of everything, the closeness of the matches they won, the draws and losses, some dominant losses. You already acknowledged that the EPL league is stronger outside the top teams.Hence my questioning the reason for you giving me those results stats.Separate point, Even though Barca and Real aren't as good as they were with Messi and Ronaldo, they still dominate their league and are a similar level to the top English sides, they still obliterate their league with a very rare exception as your stats showManutd even through their dominant patch didn't go unchallenged, the likes of Leeds, Blackburn, Arsenal, Chelsea and Man City as well as Liverpool challenged them and only on a few occasions did they win the league convincingly. It took the EPL time to get back to the levels it had reached previously be ause of the ban in Europe, the game had evolved. Eventually that culminated in 99 and from that point we've had very good success in Europe by multiple teams, if it weren't for the two Spanish teams poaching their best players  at crucial times the gap would be much closer and Real and Barca wouldn't have won so much in the last 10-15 years.I never suggested that a farmers league is called such because they farm other teams,  you even quoted the definition I gave for one in the previous paragraph to that so I'm not sure how you came to that conclusion.When a club or 2 in a league completely dominate a league both in results and points nearly always it's a farmers league for them. In your definition with the local Sunday league, if one team dominates that league it's a farmers league for them regardless of the overall quality, if it's competitive it's not a farmers league. The component that makes it a farmers league is having a team that dominates against teams that aren't real teams.The prem overall from top to bottom being superior is significant, because it shows in the way that the teams are far more competitive and always have been throughout history, it's never been a farmers league generally speaking, even when great sides have arisen such as Liverpool in the 70's and 80's and Man it's in the 90's and 00's there wasn't a gulf between them and their rivals and overall the European performance has been close to all their European counterparts. I don't agree with your conclusion that if you matched up the mid and bottom table teams in both leagues they would be even, I think EPL sides would come out on top  because the European performance alongside domestic performance shows this.",

    "comment": "@Joe I'm not sure why you are responding to me with the stats that Barca and Real had against English sides in a small window of time when Messi and Ronaldo played for them, that completely skews the overall long term median  records and even during that time there were results that went against them where English teams won against them, drew with them and others where they lost in a close match which your stats don't show.  Liverpool and Chelsea in particular had great success against them, Liverpool lost their best players just at the time Real bought Ronaldo and the others and so they got some success against them in that weak period, they wouldn't have done just a year earlier. Things are always much more complex than the results like you gave show.Just before Ronaldo went to Real, England had a period of dominance in Europe, Liverpool dominated Real in the champions league in one of those which led to them buying Ronaldo and unsettling Utds team and success by releasing to the press their interest which they have always done, buying up the majority of the world's best players, Barcelona have done the same in the last 3 decades. It doesn't in anyway refute what I've stated.Real and Barca have always dominated their league whilst the EPL is always more competitive and generally speaking the results of those two Spanish clubs haven't been dominant even when for a short period the overall results of a five year period(were even then there were periods within that where they got beat so wouldn't have dominated the English league at that time).A farmers league is a league where a team or 2 completely dominates nearly all the time over history with a massive gap in points. The results in Europe show they are not too different from other European super clubs overall, even if better overall, and their European counterparts leagues are far more competitive, this is the key element showing the difference between a farmers league and one that's not whilst also fulfilling your criteria for a competitive high level league.",

    "comment": "\u200b@Dante I decided to actually crunch the numbers. Bout to get nerdy so bear with me.If I wanted to look at how dominant a team is in a league, I can't just look at their raw points or goal difference because it doesn't take into account how relatively good it is. Instead, I need to find the league's goal difference's standard deviation. Then, I need to find how many standard deviation's a team's goal difference is from the mean, which will be 0. There's a decent amount of math that goes into it, which I wont explain unless asked.Using Standard deviation is important because it takes into account how variable  and relatively good the goal differences are. For example: If Bayern Munich has a goal difference of 20 for a season, it might seem like they had a bad year. But, if the standard deviation for goal difference in the Bundesliga was 5, then Bayern's goal difference would be four standard deviations above league average, which is an extraordinary performance. If a league's standard deviation for goal difference is lower, it means teams tend to be closer to one another in their abilities because their goal differences tend to be closer to zero on average. The more similar everyone's goal difference is, the more competitive the league tends to be. So, A lower standard deviations for the league tends to mean it is more competitive.Taking all this into account, what I did was determine both the epl and la liga's standard deviations for goal difference. I then used that to determine how many standard deviations from the mean top teams in each league were. I did this for the past 11 seasons. Then I took the average of each team and league over this 11 season timeframe. Here are the results:Prem: 27.45La Liga: 27.63Barca: 2.37Madrid: 2.04Atletico: 1.25Man City: 2.03Liverpool: 1.32Chelsea: 1.11Man U: 1.07Tottenham: 0.92Arsenal: 0.87What this means is that statistically, the Prem and La Liga are just as competitive. The variance of the goals scored across both leagues are practically the same. If the Prem were more competitive, we would expect to see it's goal difference to have a much lower standard deviation than La Liga's because in more competitive league we expect teams to have a closer goal difference. Another thing to note is that Real Madrid and Man City have basically the same average standard deviation. This means that Man City has been just as dominant in the EPL over the last 11 seasons as Madrid has been in La Liga. To suggest the overall level of play in the EPL has been significantly higher than La Liga would also be saying that Man City has been a significantly better team than Real Madrid, which we both know isn't true. If La Liga is truly a farmer's league, wouldn't we expect Real Madrid to dominate at a much higher level than Man City dominates the Prem?Yes, La Liga is more skewed towards the very top, but both league are still equally competitive. Having an opinion is one things, but an objective statistical truth is another. If you want me to share my work send me your email.",

We basically already know Barca, Real Madrid, or Atletico is winning it before the season starts.By the actual definition of a farmers league, it's not a farmers league. It's the second best league in the world. The average level of play, while slightly lower than the EPL's is still the second highest in the world. The reason why everyone is upset with you calling La Liga a farmers league is that it implies there is a poor level of play overall which takes away from the accomplishments of not only Madrid and Barca but also Messi, Ronaldo, and all the other La Liga legends.",

    "comment": "@Dante Me: If you put prime Real Madrid and Barca in the EPL, they would make it a farmers league tooYou: No they wouldn't because the league is far superior overallMe: Shows combined 27-12-8 record of barca and real vs top 6 epl teams (aka prime real madrid and barca dominating top English teams)You: I'm not sure why you are responding to me with the stats that Barca and Real had against English sides in a small window of time when Messi and Ronaldo played for themPrime Barca and Madrid dominated over the top English sides. Just because you lose and draw some games doesn't mean you're not dominant. In La Liga last season, madrid was 26-8-4 and Barca was 21-10-7. They dominated la liga, yet are comparable to the combined records prime Real and Barca had against English sides (27-12-8). If we are going to talk about long term history though, Manchester United from 1992-93 to 2012-13 won the EPL 13 out of the 20 seasons, yet only managed to win the champions league twice, which would suggest the the EPL is a farmers league by your logic: A farmers league is a league where a team or 2 completely dominates nearly all the time over history with a massive gap in points. The results in Europe show they are not too different from other European super clubs overall, even if better overall, and their European counterparts leagues are far more competitiveIt's not called a Farmer's league because the top teams farm other teams. It's meant as a dig at the level of play, suggesting that they players are farmers as their day jobs. For example, calling the Bundesliga a Farmer's league is meant as a dig at Bayern suggesting that they aren't playing against real teams. Your local Sunday League could be competitive where everyone is evenly matched, but it's still a farmer's league.The the Prem from top to bottom is a better league than La Liga, but it's not as significant as you make it out to be. Spain is still the second or third best league in the world. If you were to combine La Liga and the EPL, I doubt you would see significant trend of Spanish teams doing far worse. In other words, Bad la liga teams and Bad EPL teams are probably similar in their level of play, same with average teams. It's just that England has more Elite teams while La Liga really only has two, maybe three if you count Atletico.",

Regardless, the whole point of the term Farmers league is to describe a league with a low level of play, not one which is uncompetitive. For example, Ronaldo joining Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia. You could argue that the saudi league is more competitive than leagues like Bundesliga and ligue 1 because there is more parody in who will win the league. But we all know the level of play is higher in the bundesliga and ligue 1. If we are talking about level of play across the board, La Liga is most likely either the second or third best league in the world. If that's a farmers league, then basically every league is.",

Even the Bundesliga where Bayern dominates so much, they also have more ucl than liverpool so their league has to be more competitive in order for them to maintain such a high level throughout the season..",

By the very people meant to be looking after you, not all, but some. That's probably the same complaint many have, and if you imagine it... It's very hard for anyone else to intervene with these bullies in the system, unless there's higher powers in place, to rectify it. Though, everything else is absolutely amazing and everyone involved goes above and beyond, literal heroes of our nations, going and saving the lives of these out of place people and giving them the best they can. Community groups, direct intervention, friends made in a professional setting. The last meeting I had with my care coordinator brought us to tears, because of our friendship, and bond through the years coming to an end. So it's not all bad, like anything in life. I'll close it here, thank you for asking.",

They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire.8\u00a0In the very same way, on the strength of their dreams these ungodly people pollute their own bodies, reject authority and heap abuse on celestial beings.\u00a09\u00a0But even the archangel\u00a0Michael,\u00a0when he was disputing with the devil about the body of Moses,\u00a0did not himself dare to condemn him for slander but said, \u201cThe Lord rebuke you!\u201d[d]\u00a010\u00a0Yet these people slander whatever they do not understand, and the very things they do understand by instinct\u2014as irrational animals do\u2014will destroy them.11\u00a0Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain;\u00a0they have rushed for profit into Balaam\u2019s error;\u00a0they have been destroyed in Korah\u2019s rebellion.12\u00a0These people are blemishes at your love feasts,\u00a0eating with you without the slightest qualm\u2014shepherds who feed only themselves.\u00a0They are clouds without rain,\u00a0blown along by the wind;\u00a0autumn trees, without fruit and uprooted\u2014twice dead.\u00a013\u00a0They are wild waves of the sea,\u00a0foaming up their shame;\u00a0wandering stars, for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever.14\u00a0Enoch,\u00a0the seventh from Adam, prophesied about them: \u201cSee, the Lord is coming\u00a0with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones\u00a015\u00a0to judge\u00a0everyone, and to convict all of them of all the ungodly acts they have committed in their ungodliness, and of all the defiant words ungodly sinners have spoken against him.\u201d[e]\u00a016\u00a0These people are grumblers\u00a0and faultfinders; they follow their own evil desires;\u00a0they boast\u00a0about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage.A Call to Persevere17\u00a0But, dear friends, remember what the apostles\u00a0of our Lord Jesus Christ foretold.\u00a018\u00a0They said to you, \u201cIn the last times\u00a0there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires.\u201d\u00a019\u00a0These are the people who divide you, who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the Spirit.20\u00a0But you, dear friends, by building yourselves up\u00a0in your most holy faith\u00a0and praying in the Holy Spirit,\u00a021\u00a0keep yourselves in God\u2019s love as you wait\u00a0for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life.22\u00a0Be merciful to those who doubt;\u00a023\u00a0save others by snatching them from the fire;\u00a0to others show mercy, mixed with fear\u2014hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh.[f]Doxology24\u00a0To him who is able\u00a0to keep you from stumbling and to present you before his glorious presence\u00a0without fault\u00a0and with great joy\u2014\u00a025\u00a0to the only God\u00a0our Savior be glory, majesty, power and authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now and forevermore!\u00a0Amen.",

They did a cell extraction for an inmate who took his fecal matter, and he was covered in it from head to toe, and he even painted the walls of his cell. He was pretty sick, and I don't know why, but he was not medicated until he was wasted by staff, and inmates had to clean his cell. I just wish that they would have medications for them. The only time they get medications is for the one's in 5 point  restrains, and it was Haldol to kick him out so stuff didn't have to check on him ever 15 minutes to the official counts which there are 4 main counts but we are making rounds every 15 minutes from 12:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. I didn't like how the inmates were treated in prison they have done the crime, and now they are paying for it, no reason to cause them anymore pain. They are doing their time away from family and friends. They understand why they are in prison. Just treat them like humans who have made a decision that brought them to prison. I never judge them.

You can also exhibit some behaviors or even physical pains or even bad health via the energies from 1 or more attached spirits.Patients are locked away with these attached (kind or manipulative) spirits.

They no longer take females, as I was then, I moved to Rampton, they had a pool and I took pateients with learning disabilities on riding for the disabled on tuesdays, and helped look after guinea pigs, Rampton and Broadmoor went backwards a bit, after the Savile situation,Rampton now seems better than Broadmoor, but Broadmoor has been rebuilt, I do hope it now has returned to greater facilities for the patients, as it is needed.",

    "comment": "@Facts don\u2019t care about your feelings What about the recovery of India from the hands of the British Empire? That was done without violence, and when violence broke out amongst the people in the country it was dampened by personal sacrifice.If you've not seen the 1982 movie Gandhi, I'd say give that a watch, then read a bit about about the recovery of a whole country with non violent ways.The point being really, if it takes violence to win something, is it really worth winning? I must admit I can think of many situations where it appears that it would be worth it, but in the long run, there's still violence in the hearts of many people and it's being taught to many children as a way to solve problems.Look at the formation of Israel, the Jewish people needed a country to call their own because of the unspeakable violence done to them, they gained some land of their own, and used violence to clear that land of the non Jewish people that lived there. To this day they're suffering with the problems caused by Plan Dalet and other acts of unspeakable violence done to the people of Palestine.Is it worth it to resort to violence to fix things?Look at America and their actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, now all of a sudden Muslims are the bad guys despite the obvious actions of America utterly smashing up the region for a few decades, granted, this wasn't something done by America to fix a problem, more it was something done by them to keep money flowing in the military-industrial complex and to get their hands on all that delicious oil.Anyway, I'm very wary of violence as a way of fixing something. The people that see that violence, then live with violence in their hearts, the people that did it live with even more so, the people that had it done to them...and so on.

It's so complicated though, it's not just a religion, it's a culture, it's a binding force for good families and friends, millions of good people following all religions, religions that for some people, in some peoples minds, allows them to do terrible things. The book(s) are to blame. Religion is terrible really. I do hope you're not a Christian or catholic, then I could more empathise with you.I'm not part of the problem, trust me. I'm just taking into consideration the outcomes of many possible responses to what's going on. I don't want to be angry, but it makes me angry to see what's going on.

Jimmy was part of a gang that facilitated rape, there's politicians past and present that are organised in such ways also. These Islamic ones don't have anything to do with Islam other than the people in the gangs have Islamic backgrounds. They're certainly not doing it in the name of Islam. I'm not sure why any of these people do what they do really, it's horrifying that there's enough people out there that do this that they can make gangs. There's no point just trying to stop one over the other though, unless you just simply have a problem with Islam as well as the raping, then for you it's a double attack.As for Jim being friends with the Queen, it's just what I read really, apparently he was in with the Royal Family, with Charles being the most fond of him out of all the family members....it's not my opinion particularly!

True men of God who do deliverances ( it's not called exorcism) are successful every single time. Research what has happened to Sam. He will remain in prison for the rest of his life, however his story is astounding. Nothing fake about it at all. I can't get my head around not trying everything available when situations like this are so desperate.Psychologists need to work together with ministers who have years of experience in deliverance. The blind block against this method of healing astounds me.

I've had mental health issues since a very young age and I'm in my 30's now. I had a serious bout of psychotic episodes about 3-4 years ago and was hospitalised (not a mental health hospital). Every time I was hospitalised they made the assumption the psychosis was due to illegal street drugs - my response to this was to happily offer to take part in any drug/blood test that they wanted to take. Each time the test came back negative.It doesn't surprise me that so many people end up in places like Broadmoor and never come out. There needs to be a better understanding of mental illness. In the previous episode someone mentioned that it can take months before they are seen by a psychiatrist, well it's no better in society. I've always been under the mental health team (since my late teens) and now I've been abandoned. Only one suggestion was made, which I find laughable, and that was to 'move to a different borough where there is better mental health support'. I have a dependant, I can't just move house, it just isn't that simple. Last time I moved house I got to a point (2 days before I had to hand the keys back) where I told a family member that I had had enough, I couldn't do it. If it wasn't for my family driving 300 miles to come and rescue me, I'd be dead right now. It just got to a point where I was ready to take my own life.I really do sympathise with other people with mental health problems, it's not easy and it becomes even harder when you're labelled a criminal.

I went from being sat in a chair, talking with a couple of people, to being on the floor with someone comforting me and telling me the paramedics were on the way. I had no idea what was going on.

Especially big respect firstly for Dylan he seems very grateful for the lifeline its created and how brave to talk so honestly about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his own mother and also big respect for Mukhtaar it takes a big man to admit being thrown into a cruddy thug life and actually admit being shook and its so refreshing to gear",

Patients were so badly treated with electric shock treatment by putting electricity volts through there heads in a bid to get rid or cure mental illness. Pure evil place to be in. By the 1980s the staff who were big strong 6ft men were just battering them for there own fun, till the patients took over the place and burnend alot of it to the ground and smashed the rest to bits. And thats still meant to happen today. But not as bad. Or they would burn the new place to ground and the governer would know why they did it. Wich they cant afford. It hasnt changend.",

She a paranoid schizophrenic and she's 55yrs old and yes, she's also the size of a house. She must be well over 20st n her knees are nackered!She currently lives in a supported living place and will do for the rest of her life, as she can't look after herself. She's tried many times in the past but she can't live alone as the last time she did, she tried to kill herself and almost did it. When they revived her, she was screaming her head off saying Why didn't you let me die!!!All she suffers from now is really bad tunnel vision and she struggles to communicate due to the brain injury. She currently stays in a place with other people like herself and full time staff. The people who live there are mostly mental health and substance abuse. They are all in the older generation (which helps) as that place, isn't designed for younger (over 40's) people. Due to some of the thing's I've witnessed over the years via my aunty. I am NEVER having real children as one of my 2 twins are sleeping on my chest as I speak (cat's).

They took me to the Tindle Centre in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire where I spent 72 hours before being sent home in a taxi to my parents.Seven years later I'm so much better than I was.I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder.

I can usually tell by speaking with someone for a while, whether they will be open minded enough to think about this with no bias. The smaller their ego the more accepting and open minded they seem to be. The dose of psilocybin I took ( bare in mind I was a total psychonaut, taking LSD or shrooms at least a couple of times a month) was what Terrance McKenna called the heroic dose, 5 to 7 grams of golden teacher shrooms. On my own, laying down in a darkish room. Laying down,eyes closed. I completely lost all my ego and got answers to questions I didn't even ask. Everything about 'being' just made sense.

I try to find what I can (particularly about Broadmore) since the hospital has been mired in controversy as long as I can recall. I admire the Brits for their compassion & empathy for the profoundly mentally ill people,  despite some having committed atrocious crimes. As a nurse & a trial attorney, forensic  psych has a special place in my heart. Here in the US we did the \u201cexamination of conscience\u201d thing in the 1970\u2019s; then Reagan was elected. As the US tacked further & further to the extreme  right,  we become less concerned because - hey,\ud83e\udd37 - why not just execute them? (Some states have even eliminated insanity as a defense altogether.) It\u2019s next to impossible to have a discussion about profoundly mentally ill offenders bc any info geared toward an explanation of why the crime happened is dismissed as an \u201cexcuse.\u201d In the US, it\u2019s perfectly legal to execute the VERY crazy. If they\u2019re too psychotic to fear their upcoming execution, we pump \u2018em full of anti-psychotics so to make the condemned sufficiently lucid to appreciate his impending fate. This guarantees the public its red meat.  When the condemned person makes a serious attempt at suicide, he\u2019s air lifted to a trauma center so he can be revived from his hypoxic stupor to be terrified about his pending date with death. It also is not uncommon to execute persons with very low IQ\u2019s. (Something no longer tolerated in civilized countries.)",

As i my self a survivor of Mental Illness due to child abuse by a mother, i can feel every Pain being described in this story.. I ve been healed for 6 years, and having a wonderful family as well. Ive had became a very abusive mother as well to my only son - as the hatred to my mother has taken control all over my Soul. Ive became a Stone Cold wife as well, and very Dominat and Controling spirit.. My marriage fall apart.. And Going To Church - is not really the Answer that can heal people. Its only to even more entangled me with \u2018people pleaser\u2019 at the church. So.., apparently., Christianity really is not about Going To Church or read Bible or memorize scripture.., but really about Relationships with the Creator - through someone named Jesus. The hypocrisy in church (include my parents as Church Elder)- their Duplicity\u2014 that actually turn people away from the Real God, and God will deal with them one day. But the power to let them go and forgivey parents- that ma what really the highlight of Jesus teaching and heal me completely inside out.. Its not i found Jesus, but Jesus found me back. As a shepherd, he is longing for come back for searching Me the lost one.. and i didnt find Jesus in church or in christianity as Relegion (the ritual or activities)\u2014 but in True Christianity as Relationship.. I am an Indonesian citizen, but i will come  to this place one day, to Preach this Good News to the poor - based on the commandments of love in scripture ISAIAH 61... to the : Poor Of spirit, the poor of hope.. As Jesus gave me Reason to live (defeat the suicidal thought).., all of you here need the same Hope also.. God bless you dear all brothers here.. We are here - definitely for  a Purpose..

Not totally, not every mentally ill patient blames childhood, but it is absolutely 10000% true for many. And remember many of these patients are in their 40s\u2026.. in the 70s and 80s mental health was still so misunderstood, stigmatised and seen as something \u2018dangerous\u2019 or \u2018evil\u2019 that many of these patients didn\u2019t get the medical help they needed until things were so bad that they were thrown in prison. They\u2019re not all cut and dry criminals. Look at \u2018Adam\u2019, look how scarred and deformed his hands and arms are because of the harm he caused himself\u2026. Self harm isn\u2019t just a cry for help, it\u2019s often a person choosing to hurt themselves instead of someone else because deep down they somehow managed to learn from somewhere that hurting others is wrong. We are all born as pure beings, we don\u2019t know what to think or feel or how to behave. We are taught that, by our parents, families and by society. Just like you were. If you are told you are something enough times, it is easy to become it and believe that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to be. And these ideas and feelings are often imprinted between the ages of 8-12 years. Just remember that.",

  {
    "comment": "The heartbreaking thing is that you\u2019re so right. I used to work in a low security locked facility and the common denominator was usually the feeling, sense or physical experience of being unwanted and unloved as a child. Parents have a lot to answer for when they screw up their kids then dump them in care or on relatives because they\u2019re \u2018evil, the devil, weird, not a normal little boy or girl\u2019 etc because the kid acts out and does something perceived as screwed up or does commit a crime when all it was, was a cry for some attention and to be noticed.Obviously it\u2019s not everyone who ends up on these wards; I\u2019ve met many with very loving and very desperate families too; but abandonment or feeling hated and unwanted as a child is definitely up there as a top, common feeling among patients with illnesses such as schizophrenia, psychosis, BPD, PD etc.With my whole heart I hope that \u2018Adam\u2019 and \u2018Dylan\u2019 were successful integrating into their MSU\u2019s. What a lot of people don\u2019t realise is that these patients also very easily develop attachment anxiety and a sort of Stockholm syndrome to the routine, staff, walls and order that they feel was the first time somebody gave a genuine crap about them. The number of \u2018reoffenders\u2019 who have say one bad day, panic and do something that they know will get them transferred back to their previous \u2018safety net\u2019 is heartbreaking. A lot of the time it\u2019s not that they want to hurt staff or another patient, it\u2019s just the surest and quickest way they know that will get them sent back to familiarity. Some patients also routinely jeopardise their own progress for fear of leaving these units because they are fully aware of the stigmas that still fly around in society, which is so sad. And hard to break through.Imagine being told your entire childhood that you\u2019re not wanted and often neglected as such, developing a mental disorder because the brain tried to find a way to cope with that physical and mental trauma, then working through a gruelling recovery programme that; as this documentary shows can take 15+ years, to finally reach opportunity to integrate into society, only for society to brand you as a \u2018weirdo\u2019, \u2018dangerous\u2019, \u2018should be locked up\u2019, \u2018shouldn\u2019t be living here\u2019 etc\u2026.. And society wonders why some of these people become the things that they brand them. All their life they have been told by other people what they are. Society has as much to answer for as some parents in this scenario.It takes 2 seconds for someone to make judgement and run their mouth. Then go about their life and forget that comment after a few minutes or whatever. Someone on a recovery path could hear that and be affected for LIFE because of someone who doesn\u2019t know them. Please, please, please people - always think about your words and never dismiss someone who\u2019s been in a facility. There are often kind, funny, capable, passionate, empathetic people behind even the worst disorders and symptoms.Just make some effort to get to know the person, not the illness. That gesture alone could be the positive intervention someone needs to drive their goal of reintegration.We are all born pure beings - we don\u2019t know what to think or feel. We are taught it. Every single one of us is taught it one way or another. Always remember that when you find yourself judging someone.",

However, even psychopaths need not be serial killers, rapists, whatever....there have been many established cases of psychopaths with these very brain structure abnormalities who were raised in very loving, emotionally supportive homes, and they have been called pro-social (as opposed to anti-social) psychopaths. They are incredibly important to perform very dangerous, risky jobs bc they have absolutely NO FEAR!  So, air traffic controllers, bomb detonators, test pilots, brain and cardiac surgeons....these people are very drawn to any jobs requiring abnormally steady heads and hands, and now psychologists and psychiatrists have had their hunches proved correct!  So you\u2019re essentially right.

I\u2019ve seen it firsthand. I\u2019m not saying all of those on this program are boldfaced lying about everything, I\u2019m just saying to take it with a grain of salt.",

It will take a lot to keep all of these people on there meds and safe to re enter \u201cnormal\u201d society. Some will never be stable enough to be released. If you really think about it anyone who commits a murder isn\u2019t \u201cright\u201d in the head.  I pray for those that can be helped and I also pray for those who can\u2019t be helped enough. Mental illness is very scary!!!!! You never know what will set them off and something that set them off one day may not be an issue on another day. When does it go from a nasty criminal to a true psych issue? I wouldn\u2019t want to be the one to decide that. I think to many people blame mental illnesses on violent behavior and that is definitely not the case with all.",

Yes Canada where I live did have a paranoid schizophrenic who indeed killed a young man while on a Greyhound bus but he was one of the less than.01% of the population of schizophrenics who committed a horrific crime while NCR (Not Criminally Responsible). For half of these people in this comment section to say that the mentally ill are monsters saddens me. Just like you I am someone who is a high functioning mentally ill person living with depression and anxiety and at my last job I had a co-worker who was a high functioning paranoid schizophrenic. You are right on the money on everything. I right now guess it all comes down to how society percieves people in the mentally ill community. One of my favorite bands have two members who deal with mental illness.

Where as a cancer patient can't get better with therapy and abstinence. I think this is why people get angry when addiction is classed as an illness like cancer. The argument that addiction is a choice and cancer is not, gets brought up all the time.

Yes they have side effects but you find the right medication for you and they will be much less.

Symptom supression isn't a cure and finding the root cause is much better than to put a literal chemical labotamy on your body. I have executive dysfunction and the short period I spent on olanzapine made me more or less disabled. I couldn't even get out of bed some days. It supressed my emotions to the point I felt zombified. This was only during a section 2. Once I left I decided, with my own rational and legitimate reasons, not to hurt myself. I feel like I've tried everything and cannabis seems to help the most. It makes everything less turblent, turns off the (what I assume it to be) disconnected internal monologue and prioritises linear thought and allows for my internal monologue to be entirely of my own intended manifestation. Perhaps inflammation plays a role as well as immune function, toxins, deficiencies and genetics.I believe there are other avenues of treatment even for someone with such severe symptoms as yourself. It literally hurts me to see people get put on these drugs for life. I hope whatever you decide to do over the course of your life brings you peace as that's ultimately the most important thing. Like I said I just think there are better ways but the problem with experimentation is you can sometimes get worse, and sometimes get better for a short period and then it plateaus. Both of which is disheartening and can cause more trauma. It's difficult. Maybe one day there will be actual tests to figure out the origin of mental health issues. At the moment its stabbing in the dark with genetics, neurotransmitter dysfunction, gut bacteria, cytokine and glutamate storms, toxins, nutritional deficiencies etc. I can't imagine what your experience is like as I've always been quite lucid when experiencing it, but it doesn't mean I don't suffer greatly from it. The worst part is being an invisible illness people discredit and dismiss it a lot. I don't know if that's worse than people gaslighting you by them assuming that anything objectively looking like a pathology to them that it's related specifically to auditory hallucinations. I used to live in a hostel before I went into my own accomidation and I have sensory issues and the doors would slam due to being fire doors and having a mechanism which pulled them shut and it would shake my entire floor. I would have breakdowns after it but sometimes quite a long time after becusse I would try to stabilise my adrenals and couldn't and it builded up. Then I'd have retaliation I have been tormented by others assumptions that I'm reacting to hallucinations instead of having had passive aggressive delayed reactions. Had knock and runs and my door being kicked which was confirmed by the staff there on camera and they were spoken to.And it made my digestion really bad and adrenals to the point I was unable to make it to the toilet. I had this conflated with psychosis as opposed to the physical manifestation of my autism, something entirely unrelated to what they pathologised it to be.It's a sanist paradigm to have professionals and people afflicted by them to not only assume what you're going through but act as though (in the beginning anyway) that their opinion is infallable fact due to educated guesses. They've since realised otherwise thankfully.",

If D2 blockers helped, you have dopamine dysregulation issues by receptor cite dysfunction, abundance of dopamine production, or dopamine deficiency. There are natural ways to ameliorate this without literally chemically labotamising you with hurrendous side effects. Just because they help you doesn't mean they help everyone else. Risk Vs reward. For the majority of people who don't lose touch with reality, the risk far outweighs the reward. If all you care about is keeping out of hospital, as opposed to reducing your suffering, there lies your answer. You're scared of being put in essentially a prison more than you are of your symptoms. If you just worded it incorrectly then, again, I refer to natural methods. People don't even cycle on or off pharmas like that and it causes drastic metabolic and neurological damage. I cycle on and off every single supplement I take because otherwise it's dangerous.There are also natural muscarine antagonists avaliable. You can heal without causing further damage.Cannabis, l theanine, NAC, griffonia, mucuna pruriens, magnolia bark, vitamin B6, magnesium, omega 3, these all help me hugely.

She was a nurse in the 50's/60's and watched in horror as the Ontario Hospitals were sytematically shut and torn down. Do-gooders and gov't felt the patients should be integrated and accepted by society and shipped them off to group homes or out on their own (and many ended up on the streets, being unable to function on their own). The vast majority of these patients needed to be protected from society, with strict routines, consistent staff, consistent meds and, in some cases, enforced meds and safe shelter with little stress from the outside world. Were they perfect instiutions? No, there is no such thing. Yes, there were horror stories about abuse and neglect. Those stories still continue today in any long term care facility, retirement home, group home or treatment facility. In the OH hospital I did some of my training in, I saw maybe a dozen patients who might be able to function in a group home. When I left nursing as a long term care nurse, conditions were fast deteriorating and we were admitting more and more psych patients, who, though seniors, were still a danger to themselves and those around them, yet we were no longer allowed to restrain patients, insist that they take meds and could offer little in the way of staff consistency as so many nurses and PSW's were getting out of LTC. One psych patient on a unit with 20-22 normal elderly patients + understaffing, was a nightmare. Did I mention we were to limit writing incident reports because it reflected badly in gov't audits?",

Being able to break that cycle of abuse is the cure, the ONLY cure, and I applaud anyone that has the strength to do so, especially when they then completely cut all their abusers out of their lives. No abusers have any legitimate place in the lives of the children of those people they abused themselves whatsoever. Regardless of any familial connection, they deserve NO forgiveness. What positive experience can an abuser have on the children of a person he or she has abused? NONE!Forgiveness is bull\ud83d\udca9 where child abusers are concerned. Totally agree with you!",

He is nothing like the way he was with me to them. I had to remind myself how my father grew up. He grew up in a cold, harsh, unloving environment and he did the best he could with what he was given. People were raised differently. I would imagine if your father is 98 he was really raised in a different time than my father where they didn\u2019t care to hear from children and just thought they should do what you say and if not they would be beaten within an inch of their lives. Generations are different and way back then mental illness wasn\u2019t really talked about or accepted. There was no therapy. He may have been abused horribly in his childhood. I\u2019m not excusing his actions I\u2019m only asking you to think about what another person may have gone through in their life(your father).

Many of whom have suffered sexual abuse as children, which causes them to scrip in a way that society would generally consider criminal or requiring a custodial sentence, but without regard to their particular histories, this would seem unfair and be a further abuse considering their mental health injuries.  Most of them are so damaged that they can't look after themselves on the outside. But if they recover sufficiently, they are moved to a less secure facility and or released.  Obviously some are so messed up that they never get out.",

The teenager told police that he had been assaulted between 15 and 20 times.Two 16-year-old boys had been assaulted in their beds, Mr. Griffiths-Jones said.One teenager later told police, I did not want to do it, but he was my house tutor.The court heard that the fourth boy, a 15-year-old, went to Farr for help and advice after being sexually abused during the school holiday.But on the pretence of helping him, he was assaulted by Farr in his study, who told him it was all part of growing up, said Mr. Griffiths-Jones.Mr. Christopher Hodson, defending, said Farr was highly regarded by parents, the school chaplain, a fellow teacher and two magistrates who had written letters of support to the court on his behalf.He said Farr had been seriously injured in an accident in 1970, which could have released a repressed form of homosexuality.He has maintained that he thought what he was doing was helping him to get closer to the boys. But he now realises that it was a lack of judgment on his behalf.AffectedThis is not a homosexual housemaster, but a man whose judgment and control were affected by a serious accident which left him in intensive care for three days back in 1970, added Mr. Hodson.Judge John Evans, QC, told Farr: There must be some vindication of the feelings of outrage of parents of boys at this boarding school. They are entitled to think their youngsters are being looked after and not abused.Before...After...proven...meh..It would be a good start if children felt safe enough to be able to tell an adult and trust them to do the right thing. Then at least teachers like Alfie wouldn't be free to abuse  every year for Sixteen years.  But to put that into perspective. It's not just four boys per year who where affected. What Mr. Alan Lyndon Farr (Alfie) did was, he initiated a severe regime of bullying of the 4th Form by the Upper 5th Form old boys. This bullying was deliberately instigated with the express purpose of traumatizing his target population, making them less likely to speak out.The Standard Prison experiment was halted after five days. Imagine being compelled to live in that situation for five YEARS with no perceived viable means of escape, first as a prisoner then group pressured into the role of a guard. That's around twenty boys per annum for Sixteen years. I wonder how many of them are still suffering from PTSD and how many went on to have a career of their own.  Do you still feel like...

My concern is, what if they cannot find a job outside after being released from the ward? Of course there's a big chance for them to suffer depression once again or they might depend on drugs or alcohol which make them mentally ill again. The government must also help them find a job to help them rebuild their lives if the patients wish to leave the ward. If the government would do that thing, I believe it would make the patients feel that they're being cared for and their importance are being recognized. So, there's a big possibility that they would get well even more. But, I suggest that they'd still undergo therapy even if they feel really well. And for those patients who were drugs or alcohol dependent, they should always be reminded to turn away from those bad practices for the rest of their lives as part of the healing process and for them to be able to live healthier and happier.",

I was a psych nurse for five years on a locked inpatient unit and the patients were treated very well; they had more rights than regular patients. The only time patients were placed in seclusion was if they tried to harm themselves or somebody else, and the paperwork was extremely stringent. There had to be a justifiably legitimate reason to place people in seclusion; you couldn\u2019t just do it because you didn\u2019t like that person or want to teach them a lesson. If you have had, or know of experience to the contrary, then you should file a lawsuit. If that is the case, I\u2019m so sorry..\ud83d\ude14",

Depending on the type of mental illness you have and most importantly the severity, you could truly call some people monsters. Though not entirely their own fault, it's not atypical for those people to often refuse their medications after a certain period of time, or find an excuse to put the attention on themselves purposefully. For myself I have multiple forms of anxiety, as well as a mood disorder and depression along with PTSD and ADHD. However. I'm high functioning for the majority of my mental health, or for what I'm low functioning with (mostly my mood disorder and variably my depression) ive seeked treatment and take my meds and continue to self help. However for the public, who commonly deals with nothing more than a bout of anxious feelings once in a while, people with schizophrenia (my fiance has this), or bipolar, etc who are low functioning they don't understand how it's possible to lose so much of reality and be able to commit crimes as they have. So they are pinned as monsters. That to which we do not know, is that to which we fear the most.",

We need more hospitals, police stations, and council flats not luxury hotels... I cannot stand the conservative government!!",

It's one of the many incredibly severe failings of our government. For example: being a veteran in a psyche facility here is exactly like the most realistic prisons as depicted in docs, tv, etc. Conditions are deplorable for those with even good insurance; not even mentioning government or private institutions (for everyone). I had the RARE pleasure of watching a very close relative succeed royally in life despite this system failing him utterly, and the terrible sadness of a veteran boyfriend take his own life after living in the same ward. That's how we met; my relative introduced us. Writing this down it it sounds like r/that happened but it's all true. I wanna see THESE ppl exposed, the persons running these institutions and hospitals; that is (gonna leave my correction comment below so now you know! \ud83d\ude0a)  Back to sleep soon. Apologies for any grammar or spelling errors as I woke up from a deep sleep and am shortly headed back after a smoke. Thank you for posting. Very educating- with some shock factor; making me thankful for my reality. No one, normal ppl but especially offenders, could EVER expect even half the treatment, care, and so much more presented in this enthralling doc in our country (USA). It's not just sad; it's scary, bc it really could be any one of us to varying degrees as it's of course not merely an issue for only vets but for literally all of us. Much love to you; yes you!

Most people laugh it off and think it's  harmless,if only they knew. These people work for the system and follow instructions, set up by evil rulers who know God and Christ can heal anyone. They'd rather have people taking so called medication to keep them under control. I understand these people aren't ready to be in society but that's partly due to the wrong rehabilitation. The demons need removing from these people by having faith and turning to God for help. Prwying to God,repenting and following his commandments is the only way to fully heal someone and renew them. They have to be born again and understand that God has a plan for us all,hence life being given to us. The Devil tried to destroy these people by giving them terrible experiences. Everybody has demons of some kind,whether it be addiction,uncontrollable anger or something else,maybe a bad experience which has sent them to drugs or alcohol etc. This is Satan using his power to send the person to destruction. Many people have changes their life by believing in Christ. All kinds of people from drugs addicts to killers. Once the demons got removed, and they repented for their sins,even if it want their choice,like when Satan tempted Eve and she blamed Satan but it was her that done wrong,Adam done the same by blaming Eve but Satan stayed quiet cos he knew and didn't have to speak,it wasn't him that done it,he made her do it. Once these people realise they've got God,and follow his word,the demons won't have as much power against them,there will still be sin from time to time but eventually, sin will be gone from them.",

All of this us influenced by our feelings of love, affection and care, basically safety, which we craved as dependants and were obviously lacking in parents that were either too stressed or busy or depressed to give it, had their own issues and were abusive in whatever way or to whatever degree, or simply weren't there (to whatever degree)........",

Certain people with mental illness that were raised with rough childhoods tend to end up more prone to crime, not all but most. You're friend has mental health problems and has a good life so probably isnt anywhere near as dangerous as these people, that said not all people in the documentary had terrible childhood. So you thinking you know everything because of your friend is ridiculous, meanwhile myself who is in mental health and addictions and i have severe depression and anxiety and have an  amazing family, (also not a criminal killing and robbing people...) but what I'm getting from this is you have one friend and can say your educated and I have 2 years learning about this stuff and 10 years personal experience, but I'm not educated about this???Haha ok, seeing as I saw this today and you commented a week ago I think you're bored and need something to do",
